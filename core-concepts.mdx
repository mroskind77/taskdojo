Terminology

Feats (Not Tasks)

Task Dojo uses "feats" instead of "tasks" or "missions" in all user-facing copy. This terminology is intentional and research-backed:

Empowering: Frames activities as achievements
Action-oriented: Emphasizes accomplishment
Non-clinical: Avoids language that might feel like treatment
Motivating: Celebrates what you're capable of

<Note>
In technical documentation and code, you'll still see "task" - but always use "feat" when addressing users.
</Note>

Age Categories

Age categories affect point multipliers and determine which user types are available:

| Category | Age Range | Multiplier | User Types | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|---------|
| Grasshopper 🦗 | 6-9 years | 0.7x | Disciple only | Early childhood, basic routines |
| Cricket 🦗 | 10-12 years | 1.0x | Disciple only | Pre-teen, building independence |
| Stickbug 🪲 | 13-17 years | 1.2x | All types | Teen, increasing responsibility |
| Mantis 🦗 | 18+ years | 1.5x | All types | Adult, full complexity |

<Info>
Why different multipliers? 
Younger users complete simpler feats worth fewer base points. The multiplier ensures fair belt progression across all ages.
</Info>

Progression System

Points

Points are the primary currency of progression in Task Dojo. You earn points by completing feats, and points determine your belt level.

Point Calculation Formula:

```
Base = Feat Points × (1 + Quality + Streak + Timeliness)
Final = Base × Age Multiplier
```

Example:

A Stickbug (13-17) completes a 10-point feat with:
Quality: 5 stars (+20%)
Streak: 15 days (+20%)
Timeliness: 15 minutes early (+10%)

```
Base = 10 × (1 + 0.20 + 0.20 + 0.10) = 10 × 1.50 = 15 points
Final = 15 × 1.2 (age multiplier) = 18 points earned
```

Belt Levels

Progress through 8 belt levels based on cumulative points:

<Steps>
  <Step title="White Belt (0 pts)">
    Starting belt - Everyone begins here
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yellow Belt (150 pts)">
    First achievement - Building consistency
  </Step>
  <Step title="Orange Belt (350 pts)">
    Developing habits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Green Belt (600 pts)">
    Establishing routines
  </Step>
  <Step title="Blue Belt (900 pts)">
    Mastering fundamentals
  </Step>
  <Step title="Purple Belt (1,300 pts)">
    Advanced practitioner
  </Step>
  <Step title="Brown Belt (1,800 pts)">
    Expert level
  </Step>
  <Step title="Black Belt (2,500 pts)">
    Master of discipline
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Points are age-adjusted before checking belt requirements. A Grasshopper earning 700 raw points has 1,000 adjusted points (÷0.7), qualifying them for Blue Belt!
</Tip>

Streaks

A streak is the number of consecutive days you've completed at least one feat.

Streak Benefits:
Bonus points on feat completion
Achievement unlocks at milestones
Avatar skin unlocks
Builds momentum and habit

Streak Bonuses:
7+ days: +10% points
14+ days: +20% points
30+ days: +30% points

Streak Rules:
Complete any feat to maintain streak
Streak breaks if you miss a day
Grace Tokens can prevent breaks
Streak Savior offers last-chance protection

Grace Tokens

Grace Tokens provide streak protection:

Receive: 2 tokens every 7 days (rolling window)
Use: Automatically applied if you miss a day
Effect: Preserves your streak
Limit: Can't stockpile (max 2 at a time)

<Warning>
Grace Tokens are used automatically. You can't choose when to use them - they activate if you're about to lose your streak.
</Warning>

Streak Savior

When your streak is about to break and you're out of Grace Tokens, Streak Savior appears:

Offer: One-time option to save your streak
Cost: -50% points on next feat completion
When: Only offered once per streak break
Choice: Accept penalty or start fresh

Quality Ratings

Every completed feat receives a quality rating (1-5 stars):

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Exceptional (5 stars) - +20% points" icon="star">

Timeliness

| On-time ✅ | Within 30 minutes | 0% | Feat due at 8:00 AM, completed at 8:15 AM |
| Late ⚠️ | 30 min - 2 hours | -10% | Feat due at 8:00 AM, completed at 9:30 AM |
| Very Late ❌ | 2+ hours | -25% | Feat due at 8:00 AM, completed at 11:00 AM |
