Focus Timer

Overview

The Focus Timer is a built-in Pomodoro-style timer designed to help you maintain sustained attention during work sessions. It combats time blindness, provides structure, and helps you build deep work capacity—essential skills for executive function.

---

What Is the Focus Timer?

Pomodoro Technique

The Focus Timer implements the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks work into focused intervals with short breaks.

Standard approach:
25 minutes of focused work
5 minutes break
Repeat 4 times
Longer break (15-30 minutes)

Task Dojo's implementation:
Configurable duration (default: 20 minutes)
Visual countdown (easy to see time remaining)
Audio completion cue (know when time's up)
Overtime tracking (continues counting if needed)
Integration with feats (use for any feat)

---

Why Use the Focus Timer?

Combat Time Blindness

Time blindness is a common executive function challenge:
Can't sense how much time has passed
Lose track during work
Don't know when to stop
Struggle with time estimates

Focus Timer solves this:
✅ External time structure
✅ Visual countdown shows progress
✅ Audio cue marks completion
✅ Builds time awareness over time

---

Build Sustained Attention

Benefits of timed sessions:
Reduces distractions ("Just 20 minutes")
Creates urgency and focus
Makes work feel finite and achievable
Breaks large tasks into manageable chunks

Research evidence: 55% of users prefer visual time blocks for managing time blindness. Focus Timer provides that structure.

---

Track Deep Work

Each completed session:
Counts toward Focus Master achievement (10 sessions)
Unlocks Focus Master avatar (🎯)
Builds your deep work capacity
Proves you can sustain attention

Visual Display

Countdown Display

Large, clear numbers:
```
20:00  →  19:59  →  19:58  →  ...  →  00:01  →  00:00
```

Color coding:
Green: >25% time remaining
Yellow: 10-25% time remaining
Orange: <10% time remaining
Red: <5% time remaining (almost done!)

---

Progress Ring

Visual circle around timer:
Fills as time elapses
Shows proportional progress
Glanceable status check
Satisfying visual feedback

Example:
10 minutes into 20-minute session = 50% ring filled
18 minutes into 20-minute session = 90% ring filled

---

Overtime Mode

What happens at 00:00:
Timer continues counting (goes negative)
Shows overtime: "-00:01, -00:02, etc."
Audio cue plays once at zero
Visual changes to indicate overtime

Why overtime exists:
Sometimes you need a few more minutes
Finish thought/paragraph
Complete current step
No pressure to stop instantly

Overtime is okay occasionally, but:
Goal is to finish within time
Overtime = re-evaluate duration
Builds estimation skills

Focus Timer Strategies

For Different Feat Types

Homework/Study Sessions

Recommended duration: 20-30 minutes

Process:
Set up materials before starting timer
Start timer
Work only on assigned homework
Take 5-minute break after
Repeat if more homework

Why it works: Homework often feels endless. Timer creates finite, achievable chunk.

---

Deep Work / Projects

Recommended duration: 45-60 minutes

Process:
Eliminate all distractions
Set longer timer
Deep, focused work on one project
Take 10-15 minute break after
Celebrate significant progress!

Why it works: Deep work requires sustained attention. Timer provides structure and urgency.

---

Chores / Physical Tasks

Recommended duration: 15-20 minutes

Process:
Start timer
Work quickly and efficiently
Race against the clock
Celebrate when done before time!

Why it works: Chores are more fun with a challenge. Timer adds game-like element.

---

Rescue Quests

Required duration: 30 minutes (fixed)

Process:
Streak broken, Grace Token available
Choose Rescue Quest
Timer opens at 30 minutes
Complete focused session
Streak restored! ✅

Why 30 minutes: Rescue Quest should be meaningful effort, not trivial. 30 minutes proves commitment.

---

Building Focus Capacity

Start Small

Week 1: 10-15 minute sessions
Build the habit
Get comfortable with timer
Practice eliminating distractions

Week 2-3: 20-25 minute sessions
Standard Pomodoro duration
Sustainable for most work
Balance focus and breaks

Week 4+: 30-45 minute sessions (as needed)
For deep work
When flow state achieved
Complex tasks requiring sustained attention

Don't start with 60-minute sessions! Build capacity gradually.

---

Track Your Sessions

Goal: 10 completed sessions
Unlocks Focus Master achievement
Unlocks Focus Master avatar (🎯)
Proves deep work capability

How to track:
Profile shows completed focus sessions
Achievement progress bar
Personal tracking (journal/notes)

---

Identify Optimal Duration

Experiment to find your best duration:
Try 15, 20, 25, 30 minutes
Notice when focus wanes
Adjust based on feat type
Personalize your approach

Signs duration is right:
✅ Can maintain focus throughout
✅ Complete meaningful work
✅ Feel accomplished, not exhausted
✅ Ready for brief break after

Signs to adjust:
❌ Can't maintain focus (too long)
❌ Timer ends before you get into flow (too short)
❌ Constantly going into overtime (too short)
❌ Feeling overwhelmed (too long)

Common Questions

Q: Can I use the timer for multiple feats?  
A: Yes, but it's designed for one feat per session. Better to do separate timers for each feat.

Q: What if I finish before the timer?  
A: Great! Mark feat complete, let timer finish, then take your break early.

Q: Can I extend the timer mid-session?  
A: No. If you need more time, let it go into overtime, or start a new session after a break.

Q: Does using the timer give extra points?  
A: No, but it counts toward Focus Master achievement (10 sessions).

Q: Can I use an external timer instead?  
A: Yes! But built-in timer tracks toward achievements.

Q: What if timer stresses me out?  
A: Try shorter durations (10-15 min) or skip the timer. It's a tool, not a requirement.
