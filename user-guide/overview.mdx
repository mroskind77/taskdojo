Philosophy

Task Dojo is built on three core principles:

1. Empowerment Over Shame

We use validating, empowering language that acknowledges challenges without judgment:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="✅ We Say">
"Building your streak takes practice"
"Every feat completed is progress"
"You're developing valuable skills"
"This is worth celebrating"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="❌ We Don't Say">
"You failed"
"You should have done better"
"This is disappointing"
"Try harder"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. Progress Over Perfection

Quality matters, but we celebrate all progress:

3-star completion is perfectly acceptable
Consistency beats perfection
Grace Tokens and Streak Savior provide support
Focus on building sustainable habits

3. Support Over Punishment

No punitive mechanics:

✅ Streak protection with Grace Tokens
✅ Voluntary penalty with Streak Savior
✅ Quality ratings provide guidance, not shame
❌ No life loss
❌ No failure states
❌ No permanent setbacks
