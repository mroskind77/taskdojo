Quality Rating System

What Is Quality Rating?

Quality rating is how you (or your Sensei) assess how well you completed the feat. It's not about perfection—it's about honest self-assessment.

Quality affects your points: Higher quality = more points earned!

---

The Four Quality Levels

⭐ Poor (0.5x multiplier)

When to use:
You barely finished
Lots of distractions or resistance
Minimum effort, just got through it
Know you could have done better

Example:
Started homework but got distracted 5 times
Rushed through morning routine
Completed task but quality suffered

Points: You still earn points! Just fewer. 50% of base points.

Mindset: "I did it even though it was hard. That counts."

---

⭐⭐ Fair (0.75x multiplier)

When to use:
Got it done, some effort
A few distractions or challenges
Met minimum requirements
Could have been better, but acceptable

Example:
Completed homework with moderate focus
Morning routine done with a few skipped steps
Task complete but could improve

Points: 75% of base points.

Mindset: "Good enough for today. I can improve tomorrow."

---

⭐⭐⭐ Good (1.0x multiplier)

When to use:
Solid, focused effort
Met expectations
Normal performance
No major issues

Example:
Completed homework with good focus
Morning routine done as planned
Task finished competently

Points: 100% of base points (standard).

Mindset: "This is my baseline. I'm showing up."

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent (1.5x multiplier)

When to use:
Exceptional effort and focus
Exceeded expectations
Went above and beyond
Really proud of this one

Example:
Completed homework early and reviewed extra material
Morning routine done efficiently with time to spare
Task finished with care and attention to detail

Points: 150% of base points (1.5x bonus!).

Mindset: "I crushed this. I'm building momentum."

---

How to Rate Quality Honestly

The Goal: Honest self-assessment, not perfection or judgment.

Guidelines:

✅ Be honest with yourself - You're building self-awareness  
✅ Consider effort AND outcome - Trying hard with poor results can still be Fair/Good  
✅ Most completions are "Good" - That's your baseline  
✅ Reserve "Excellent" for genuine excellence - Makes it meaningful  
✅ "Poor" still counts - You showed up, that matters

❌ Don't always choose "Excellent" - Devalues the system  
❌ Don't punish yourself with "Poor" - If you completed it, give yourself credit  
❌ Don't overthink it - 5 seconds to decide, move on

Rule of thumb:
70% of your completions should be "Good"
15-20% should be "Fair"
10-15% should be "Excellent"
<5% should be "Poor"

---

Points Calculation

The Formula

When you complete a feat, points are calculated using this formula:
```

Total Points = Base Points × Quality Multiplier × Timeliness Multiplier × (1 + Streak Bonus) × Age Multiplier

```

Let's break it down:

---

1. Base Points (Difficulty)

Set when you create the feat:
Easy: 10 points
Medium: 25 points
Hard: 50 points
Epic: 100 points

---

2. Quality Multiplier

Based on your rating:
Poor: 0.5x
Fair: 0.75x
Good: 1.0x
Excellent: 1.5x

---

3. Timeliness Multiplier

Current Status: Not yet implemented (coming soon!)

Planned:
Early: +20% (completed before due date)
On-time: +10% (completed on due date)
No penalty: (completed within 24 hours after due)
Late: -10% (completed 1-3 days late)
Very late: -25% (completed >3 days late)

---

4. Streak Bonus

Based on current streak:
0-2 days: No bonus
3-6 days: +10%
7-13 days: +20%
14-20 days: +30%
21-29 days: +40%
30+ days: +50% (maximum!)

Example: 7-day streak = multiply by 1.2 (20% bonus)

---

5. Age Multiplier

Based on your age category:
Grasshopper (5-8): 1.0x
Cricket (9-12): 1.2x
Stickbug (13-15): 1.5x
Mantis (16+): 2.0x

---

Example Calculations

Example 1: Simple Completion

Feat: "Morning Routine"
Difficulty: Medium (25 base points)
Quality: Good (1.0x)
Timeliness: N/A (not implemented)
Streak: 5 days (1.1x = +10%)
Age: Cricket (1.2x)

Calculation:
```

25 × 1.0 × 1.1 × 1.2 = 33 points

```

You earn: 33 points!

---

Example 2: Excellent Performance

Feat: "Complete homework"
Difficulty: Hard (50 base points)
Quality: Excellent (1.5x)
Timeliness: N/A
Streak: 14 days (1.3x = +30%)
Age: Stickbug (1.5x)

Calculation:
```

50 × 1.5 × 1.3 × 1.5 = 146.25 → 146 points

```

You earn: 146 points! 🎉

---

Example 3: Struggled But Finished

Feat: "Study for test"
Difficulty: Epic (100 base points)
Quality: Poor (0.5x) - "I got distracted a lot but finished"
Timeliness: N/A
Streak: 0 days (just starting)
Age: Mantis (2.0x)

Calculation:
```

100 × 0.5 × 1.0 × 2.0 = 100 points

```

You earn: 100 points!

Notice: Even with "Poor" quality, you still earned 100 points because:
You completed an Epic feat (100 base)
Your Mantis multiplier (2.0x) compensated for poor quality
You showed up and finished despite struggle!

---

The Celebration System

What Happens When You Complete a Feat

For Masters:

Immediate feedback
Points calculation shown
"Nice work! +33 points earned. You're crushing it!"

Celebration animation
Confetti explosion 🎊
Points counter animation
Visual feedback of progress

Progress updates
Points added to total
Belt progress bar updates
Streak continues (if completed today)

Special celebrations for milestones:
Belt Level-Up: Extra confetti, belt display animation
Achievement Unlocked: Badge reveal animation
Avatar Unlocked: New avatar skin preview
Streak Milestone: Streak celebration (7, 14, 30 days)

---

For Disciples

Completion flow is different because approval is required:

Submit for approval
"Submitted! Your Sensei will review this soon. Great effort!"
Feat marked as "Pending"

Wait for Sensei
No points awarded yet
Feat shows "Pending Approval" badge
You can add notes or context

Approval notification
When Sensei approves, you see:
Points earned (with Sensei's quality rating)
Sensei's encouraging notes
Progress updates

Full celebration
Same confetti and animation as Masters
Belt progress updates
Achievements unlock

Why this matters:
Builds accountability
Creates feedback loop with Sensei
Teaches self-reflection
Path toward eventual independence

---

Adding Notes (Disciples)

Why Add Notes?

When requesting approval, you can add notes to your feat completion. This helps your Sensei understand:
What went well
Where you struggled
What you learned
Any questions or concerns

Benefits:
Better feedback from Sensei
More accurate quality ratings
Builds reflection skills
Strengthens communication

---

What to Include in Notes

Good note examples:

✅ "I finished all the problems! #5 was really hard but I figured it out."  
✅ "I did my morning routine even though I didn't want to get up."  
✅ "I got distracted during homework but came back to finish it."  
✅ "This was easier than I thought it would be!"  
✅ "Can you help me understand the last question?"

Less helpful notes:

❌ "Done." (too brief, no context)  
❌ "I don't know." (not helpful for Sensei)  
❌ Blank (missed opportunity for feedback)

Remember: Notes are optional, but they help your Sensei give you better feedback and more accurate quality ratings.

Best Practices for Completing Feats

Complete Feats Shortly After Doing Them

Why: 
Maintains streak accuracy
Better quality self-assessment
Immediate reinforcement
Don't forget what you did!

When:
Right after finishing (ideal)
End of category (e.g., after all morning feats)
Evening check-in (review day and mark complete)

---

Be Honest with Quality Ratings

Why:
Builds self-awareness
Accurate progress tracking
More meaningful when you earn "Excellent"
You're only competing with yourself

How:
Use "Good" as baseline
Reserve "Excellent" for truly exceptional
Don't punish yourself with "Poor" unless genuine
Be consistent in your standards

---

Celebrate Every Completion

Why:
Reinforces positive behavior
Builds momentum
Combats executive dysfunction
You deserve recognition!

How:
Read the celebration message (don't skip it!)
Notice the confetti
Check your progress bar
Allow yourself to feel proud

Even for "Easy" feats:
You built your streak
You earned points
You took action
That matters!

---

Complete at Least One Feat Daily

Why:
Maintains your streak
Earns streak bonuses (+10% to +50%)
Builds habit
Prevents streak loss

Strategy:
Start with one Easy feat (low barrier)
Add more as momentum builds
Streak = compound interest for points!

---

For Senseis: Approving Completions

The Approval Workflow

When a Disciple completes a feat:

Notification appears in your Sensei dashboard
Pending approvals counter
List of submitted feats

Review the completion
Read feat title and description
Review any notes Disciple added
Consider effort and outcome

Rate quality honestly
Use same criteria (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)
Consider Disciple's notes
Balance encouragement with accuracy

Add Sensei Notes (highly recommended!)
"Great work on persisting through that tough problem!"
"I noticed you struggled with #5—let's review that together."
"You're building a strong streak! Keep it up!"
"Excellent focus this morning—I'm proud of you!"

Approve or provide feedback
Click "Approve" → Points awarded, celebration triggers
Click "Needs Revision" → Feat returns to Disciple with notes

---

Sensei Approval Best Practices

✅ Approve within 24 hours when possible - Timely feedback matters  
✅ Write encouraging notes - Even for imperfect completions  
✅ Be honest with quality - Helps Disciple build self-awareness  
✅ Ask questions in notes - "What was hardest about this?"  
✅ Celebrate effort, not just results - Building discipline is the goal  

❌ Don't always rate "Excellent" - Devalues the system  
❌ Don't be overly critical - Focus on encouragement  
❌ Don't delay approvals - Breaks momentum  
❌ Don't approve without reviewing - You're building trust

Sample Sensei Notes

For "Excellent" completion:
>
 "Wow! You not only finished your homework but also reviewed extra problems. That's what mastery looks like! 🌟"

For "Good" completion:
"
Solid work on your morning routine! You're building consistency—keep it up! 💪"

For "Fair" completion:
"
You got it done even though it was hard. That takes courage. Tomorrow, let's try breaking it into smaller steps."

For "Poor" but complete:
"I
 see you struggled today. That's OK—you still finished! Let's talk about what made it hard and how we can help."

For needing revision:
"I
 noticed you marked this complete, but we agreed you'd finish all 10 problems. Can you complete the last 3? I know you can do this!"

Common Completion Questions

Q: What if I forget to mark a feat complete?  
A: Mark it complete the next day! It still counts, though it might affect streaks if you go 24+ hours without completing anything.

Q: Can I change my quality rating after submitting?  
A: Not currently. Choose thoughtfully before submitting.

Q: What if I only partially completed a feat?  
A: Either rate it "Poor" and still complete, or don't mark it complete and try again tomorrow.

Q: Do I need to complete feats in order?  
A: No! Complete them in whatever order works for you.

Q: Can I complete the same feat multiple times?  
A: Not yet. Create duplicate feats if you need recurring tasks, or use templates.

Q: How long does Sensei approval take?  
A: Varies by Sensei, but most approve within 24 hours. Be patient!

Q: What happens if Sensei never approves?  
A: Feat stays "Pending." Talk to your Sensei! If needed, contact support.
