Belt System

Overview

Task Dojo's belt progression system is inspired by martial arts, where earning each new belt represents mastery and growth. Just like in a dojo, you start as a White Belt and advance through dedicated practice—one feat at a time.

Your belt is a visible symbol of your discipline and progress.

---

The Nine Belts

Belt Progression Path

Everyone starts at White Belt and advances through nine belt levels:

⚪ White Belt - The Beginning (0 points)
🟡 Yellow Belt - First Steps (150 points)
🟠 Orange Belt - Building Momentum (350 points)
🟢 Green Belt - Growing Consistency (600 points)
🔵 Blue Belt - Developing Mastery (900 points)
🟣 Purple Belt - Advanced Discipline (1,300 points)
🔴 Red Belt - Expert Focus (1,800 points)
🟤 Brown Belt - Near Mastery (2,500 points)
⚫ Black Belt - True Master (3,500 points)

---

Belt Requirements

Points Needed by Belt

| Belt | Total Points Required | Points from Previous Belt | Estimated Time* |

| ⚪ White | 0 | — | Start |
| 🟡 Yellow | 150 | +150 | 3-4 weeks |
| 🟠 Orange | 350 | +200 | 4-5 weeks more |
| 🟢 Green | 600 | +250 | 6-7 weeks more |

How Belt Progression Works

Earning Points

You earn points by completing feats. Points are calculated using:

```
Total Points = Base Points × Quality × Timeliness × (1 + Streak Bonus) × Age Multiplier
```

Each completed feat adds to your total points, bringing you closer to the next belt.

See Points Earning for detailed calculation breakdown.

---

Automatic Belt Advancement

When you reach the required points:

Automatic level-up - No manual action needed
Special celebration animation - Extra confetti, fanfare!
Belt display updates - New belt color shown
Achievement unlocked - Belt milestone badge
Possible avatar unlock - Some belts unlock new avatar skins!

Example:
You have 145 points (White Belt)
You complete a feat worth 10 points
Total becomes 155 points
🎉 YELLOW BELT UNLOCKED! 🎉
Celebration triggers automatically

---

You Never Lose Belts

Important: Belt progression is permanent. You never lose a belt, even if:
You take a break from Task Dojo
Your streak resets
You have a bad day

Why this matters:
Progress is real and lasting
Reduces anxiety about "losing" achievements
Encourages long-term growth over perfection

---

Belt Tiers and Progression Pace

The Four Tiers

Belt progression is designed with increasing gaps between levels, matching skill development:

---

Tier 1: Beginner Belts (White → Orange)

Belts: White, Yellow, Orange  
Total Points: 0 → 350  
Pace: Relatively quick progression  
Purpose: Build momentum, establish habit

Why fast:
New users need frequent wins
Builds engagement and confidence
Establishes the habit of completing feats

Time: ~8-12 weeks to reach Orange Belt

---

Tier 2: Intermediate Belts (Green → Blue)

Belts: Green, Blue  
Total Points: 600 → 900  
Pace: Moderate progression  
Purpose: Deepen skills, build consistency

Why moderate:
Users understand the system
Building true discipline takes time
Prevents reward devaluation

Time: ~14-20 weeks to reach Blue Belt from Green

---

Tier 3: Advanced Belts (Purple → Red)

Belts: Purple, Red  
Total Points: 1,300 → 1,800  
Pace: Slower, more challenging  
Purpose: Demonstrate mastery

Why slower:
These belts mean something significant
Separates casual users from committed ones
Reflects real skill development

Time: ~22-28 weeks to reach Red Belt from Purple

---

Tier 4: Expert Belt (Brown → Black)

Belts: Brown, Black  
Total Points: 2,500 → 3,500  
Pace: Long-term commitment  
Purpose: True mastery

Why longest:
Black Belt is a major achievement
Represents 1+ year of consistent effort
Meaningful and prestigious

Time: ~30+ weeks to reach Black Belt from Brown

Total Time to Black Belt: 1-2 years depending on age category and consistency

---

Age-Adjusted Belt Requirements

How Age Category Affects Progression

Belt point requirements are the same for everyone, but your age multiplier affects how fast you earn points.

Recall the age multipliers:
Grasshopper (5-8): 1.0x
Cricket (9-12): 1.2x
Stickbug (13-15): 1.5x
Mantis (16+): 2.0x

---

Example: Time to Yellow Belt (150 points)

Assuming ~5 base points/day with Good quality and no streak:

| Age Category | Multiplier | Adjusted Points/Day | Days to Yellow | Weeks to Yellow |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Grasshopper | 1.0x | 5 pts/day | 30 days | ~4 weeks |
| Cricket | 1.2x | 6 pts/day | 25 days | ~3.5 weeks |
| Stickbug | 1.5x | 7.5 pts/day | 20 days | ~3 weeks |
| Mantis | 2.0x | 10 pts/day | 15 days | ~2 weeks |

This ensures:
Younger users aren't discouraged by slow progress
Older users maintain appropriate challenge
Everyone reaches Yellow Belt in ~3-4 weeks (research-backed optimal pace)

Belt Progression Strategies

How to Advance Faster (Ethically)

1. Maintain a Streak
Complete at least 1 feat daily
Streak bonuses compound: +10% to +50%
30-day streak = 50% more points on every feat!

2. Focus on Quality
Rate yourself "Good" consistently
Aim for "Excellent" when you truly excel
Honest quality builds skills and points

3. Complete Higher-Difficulty Feats
Mix of Easy, Medium, Hard feats
Don't avoid Hard/Epic feats—they're worth it!
Use AI Breakdown to make Epic feats manageable

4. Leverage Age Multiplier
If you're Stickbug/Mantis, you naturally earn more points
Grasshopper/Cricket users: focus on consistency over time

5. Use Templates
Templates provide structured, high-value feat chains
Morning + Evening routines = consistent daily points
Build habits that generate automatic progress

---

What NOT to Do

❌ Don't create fake "easy" feats - Gaming the system teaches nothing  
❌ Don't always rate "Excellent" - Devalues the system and your growth  
❌ Don't rush - Belt progression should match real skill development  
❌ Don't compare - Your journey is yours; focus on personal growth  

Remember: The belt represents real discipline and real skills. Shortcuts rob you of growth.

For Senseis: Belt Progression with Disciples

Tracking Disciple Progress

As a Sensei, you can see:
Each disciple's current belt
Points toward next belt
Belt progression history
Comparison across disciples (for insights, not competition)

Use belt progress to:
Celebrate milestones together
Identify when disciples need encouragement
Plan appropriate feat difficulty
Build motivation through visible growth

---

Celebrating Belt Achievements

When your disciple earns a new belt:

✅ Acknowledge it immediately - "You earned Orange Belt! That's huge!"  
✅ Discuss what it represents - "This shows you're building real consistency."  
✅ Set sights on next belt - "Green Belt is next—what will help you get there?"  
✅ Use it as a teaching moment - "Notice how your streak helped you advance faster?"

Make belt achievements a big deal—they ARE a big deal!

---

Belt Philosophy

What Belts Represent

Not just points:
Belts represent discipline, not perfection
They show consistency, not intensity
They demonstrate growth, not comparison with others

Earned through:
Daily small actions
Showing up even when it's hard
Building habits over time
Honest self-assessment

What belts don't represent:
Intelligence or capability
Comparison with others
Perfection or flawlessness
Speed over sustainability

---

The Black Belt Mindset

In martial arts, earning a Black Belt doesn't mean you've "finished"—it means you've mastered the fundamentals and are ready to truly begin.

Same in Task Dojo:
Black Belt is an achievement worth celebrating
It also marks the beginning of sustainable discipline
Mastery is maintaining the practice, not reaching a destination

A Black Belt in Task Dojo says:
>
 "I've built the skills to manage my focus and transform overwhelm into action. I'm ready to apply this discipline to anything I pursue."
