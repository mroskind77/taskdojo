Sensei Guide: Overview

Welcome, Sensei

As a Sensei in Task Dojo, you're taking on the role of guide, mentor, and supporter for learners who benefit from structure and accountability. This isn't about control—it's about providing scaffolding that helps disciples build executive function skills and eventually independence.

Your role is critical. Thank you for showing up for your disciples.

What Is a Sensei?

The Mentor Role

Sensei (Japanese: 先生) means "teacher" or "one who has gone before."

In Task Dojo, a Sensei:
Creates and manages disciple accounts
Approves feat completions
Provides encouraging feedback
Tracks disciple progress
Models good task management

You're not:
❌ A taskmaster dictating all feats
❌ A judge punishing failures
❌ A helicopter parent micromanaging
❌ Responsible for your disciple's every action

You are:
✅ A guide providing structure
✅ A supporter celebrating progress
✅ A teacher building skills
✅ A role model demonstrating discipline

Why Task Dojo Needs Senseis

The Research Behind Approval Systems

58% of neurodivergent users need external accountability:
Executive dysfunction makes self-management hard
External checkpoints provide necessary structure
Feedback loops build self-awareness
Approval creates motivation beyond points

The Sensei-Disciple relationship:
Reduces anxiety about "doing it right"
Provides regular check-ins
Builds trust and communication
Creates path toward independence

Goal: Disciples eventually become Masters (independent users)

Sensei Account Setup

Creating Your Sensei Account

During onboarding:
Choose "Sensei" as account type
Select your age category (for your own progress)
Pick your starting avatar
Complete profile setup

After setup:
You have a full Master-level account
Plus Sensei-specific features
Manage your own feats AND disciples' feats
Access Sensei Insights dashboard

---

Your Dual Role

As a Sensei, you are also a Master:

Your own feats:
Create and complete your own feats
Build your own belt progression
Maintain your own streaks
Unlock your own achievements

Why this matters:
✅ Model good habits for disciples
✅ Build empathy for the work
✅ Show that you practice what you teach
✅ Demonstrate discipline through action

Best practice: Use Task Dojo yourself actively. Don't just manage disciples—show them how it's done!

Sensei Best Practices

Do's and Don'ts

✅ DO:

Approve promptly
Within 24 hours when possible
Timely feedback maintains momentum
Delays kill motivation

Write encouraging notes
Every approval should have a note
Even for imperfect work
Specific praise is most effective

Be honest with quality ratings
Don't always rate "Excellent"
Honest assessment builds self-awareness

Celebrate effort, not just results
Trying matters more than perfection
Process over outcome
Building discipline is the goal

---

❌ DON'T:

Be overly critical
Focus on encouragement
Guide, don't judge
Avoid harsh language

Always rate "Excellent"
Devalues the system
Prevents learning
Makes "Excellent" meaningless

Delay approvals indefinitely
Breaks disciple's momentum
Creates frustration
Reduces engagement

Compare disciples
Each journey is unique
Comparison breeds resentment
Focus on individual growth

Create ALL their feats
Leave room for their input
Encourage initiative
Support, don't control

Use Task Dojo as punishment
It's a support tool, not a weapon
Don't add feats as punishment
Keep it positive and empowering

---

Managing Multiple Disciples

How Many Disciples?

Recommended: 1-5 disciples

Why this limit:
Quality feedback requires time
Each disciple needs individual attention
More disciples = more approvals daily
Risk of burnout if too many

Start with 1-2:
Learn the system
Develop your Sensei rhythm
Add more once comfortable

---

Organization Strategies

Create routines:
Review approvals at same time daily
Morning check-in, evening approval
Consistent timing builds expectations

Prioritize urgent items:
Disciples with broken streaks
Overdue approvals
Struggling disciples

Use Insights:
Identify who needs more support
Spot patterns requiring intervention
Data-driven decisions

---

Teaching Moments

Sensei as Educator

Use Task Dojo to teach:

Executive Function Skills:
Planning and prioritization
Time estimation
Task decomposition
Self-assessment

Growth Mindset:
Effort matters more than results
Mistakes are learning opportunities
Progress, not perfection
Consistency builds capacity

Self-Management:
Creating own feats
Breaking down big tasks
Using tools (Timer, Breakdown)
Building routines

Accountability:
Following through on commitments

Building Toward Independence

The Ultimate Goal

Disciples → Masters

Your job is to work yourself out of a job!

Signs disciple is ready for more independence:
Creates most of their own feats
Honest with quality self-assessment
Maintains streaks without constant reminders
Uses tools (Timer, Breakdown) effectively
Demonstrates planning skills

Gradual independence:
Start: Sensei creates most feats, approves all
Middle: Disciple creates more, Sensei approves
Later: Disciple self-manages more, spot-checks only
Eventually: Transition to Master account (future feature)

Common Sensei Questions

Q: How many disciples can I manage?  
A: No hard limit, but 1-5 recommended for quality feedback.

Q: Can I be both Sensei and Disciple?  
A: Not currently. You can be a Sensei (which includes Master capabilities) or a Disciple, but not both roles simultaneously.

Q: Do I have to approve every feat?  
A: Yes, disciples don't earn points until approved. This is the core of the accountability system.

Q: What if I'm busy and can't approve promptly?  
A: Set expectations with disciples. Batch approve once daily. But consistency matters—don't leave them hanging for days.

Q: Can disciples see my feats?  
A: Not currently. Your feats are private unless you share your screen/progress with them.

Q: What if a disciple cheats or games the system?  
A: Have an honest conversation. Explain that they're only cheating themselves. Consider whether Task Dojo is the right tool for them right now.

Q: Can I transfer a disciple to another Sensei?  
A: Not currently. Contact support if you need to transfer.

Q: Do I earn points for being a Sensei?  
A: Yes—your own points from your own feats! Plus there are Sensei-specific achievements.
