Points Earning Guide

Overview

Points are the currency of discipline in Task Dojo. Every feat you complete earns points based on difficulty, quality, timeliness, streaks, and your age category. Understanding how points are calculated helps you maximize your progress and advance your belt rank strategically.

The Points Formula

Complete Calculation

```
Total Points = Base Points × Quality Multiplier × Timeliness Multiplier × (1 + Streak Bonus) × Age Multiplier
```

Let's break down each component:

---

1. Base Points (Difficulty)

Base points are determined by the difficulty you assign when creating a feat.

The Four Difficulty Levels

Easy - 10 Points
Takes <10 minutes
Simple, single-step tasks
Low cognitive load
Routine maintenance

Examples:
Brush teeth
Make bed
Check email
Drink water

---

Medium - 25 Points
Takes 10-30 minutes
Multi-step or moderate effort
Some planning or focus required
Standard daily tasks

Examples:
Morning routine
Clean desk
Practice instrument (15 min)
Review notes

---

Hard - 50 Points
Takes 30-60 minutes
Complex or requires sustained focus
Multiple steps or decisions
Significant accomplishment

Examples:
Complete homework assignment
Deep work session
Organize closet
Study for test (1 hour)

---

Epic - 100 Points
Takes 60+ minutes
Very complex or high-stakes
Major accomplishment
Often benefits from AI Breakdown

Examples:
Study for exam (2+ hours)
Complete major project
Deep clean room
Write essay

---

2. Quality Multiplier

Quality reflects how well you completed the feat. Rate yourself honestly for accurate self-assessment and appropriate points.

Quality Ratings and Multipliers

⭐ Poor - 0.5x (50% of base points)
Struggled significantly
Lots of distractions
Barely finished
Minimum effort

Example: Started homework, got distracted 5+ times, rushed through

---

⭐⭐ Fair - 0.75x (75% of base points)
Got it done with some effort
A few distractions or challenges
Met minimum requirements
Could improve but acceptable

Example: Completed homework with moderate focus, acceptable quality

---

⭐⭐⭐ Good - 1.0x (100% of base points)
Solid, focused effort
Met expectations
Normal, baseline performance
No major issues

Example: Completed homework with good focus, met all requirements

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent - 1.5x (150% of base points)
Exceptional effort and focus
Exceeded expectations
Went above and beyond
Genuinely proud of this work

Example: Completed homework early, reviewed extra material, helped a friend

---

Quality Rating Guidelines

Most completions should be "Good" (70%):
This is your baseline
Standard performance
No bonus, no penalty

Reserve "Excellent" for genuine excellence (10-15%):
Makes it meaningful when earned
Rewards true exceptional effort
Don't overuse or it loses value

"Fair" for acceptable but imperfect (15-20%):
You finished despite challenges
Met minimum standards
Still worth points!

"Poor" for struggles (less than 5%):
You barely made it through
BUT you still finished and get credit
Honest self-assessment

---

3. Timeliness Multiplier

Current Status: ⚠️ Not yet implemented (coming soon!)

Planned Timeliness Bonuses/Penalties

When implemented, completing feats relative to their due date will affect points:

Early - +20% bonus (1.2x)
Completed 1+ days before due date
Rewards proactive planning
Prevents procrastination

On-Time - +10% bonus (1.1x)
Completed on due date
Rewards meeting deadlines
Standard expectation

No Penalty - 1.0x (no change)
Completed within 24 hours after due date
Grace period
Life happens

Late - -10% penalty (0.9x)
Completed 1-3 days late
Small consequence
Still worth completing

Very Late - -25% penalty (0.75x)
Completed 4+ days late
Larger consequence
But still better than not completing!

Note: Timeliness will be optional. Feats without due dates won't have timeliness multipliers.

---

4. Streak Bonus

Your current streak (consecutive days with at least 1 completion) earns escalating bonuses.

Streak Bonus Tiers

| Streak Length | Bonus | Multiplier |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| 0-2 days | No bonus | 1.0x |
| 3-6 days | +10% | 1.1x |
| 7-13 days | +20% | 1.2x |
| 14-20 days | +30% | 1.3x |
| 21-29 days | +40% | 1.4x |
| 30+ days | +50% (max) | 1.5x |

Key insights:
Streaks compound your points over time
30-day streak = 50% more points on EVERY feat!
Maintain daily completions for maximum benefit
Use Grace Tokens to protect long streaks

Example impact:
10-point Easy feat with 7-day streak: 10 × 1.2 = 12 points
Same feat with 30-day streak: 10 × 1.5 = 15 points
50% more points just from consistency!

---

5. Age Multiplier

Your age category adjusts point earning to match developmental stage and task complexity.

Age Category Multipliers

🦗 Grasshopper (Ages 5-8) - 1.0x
Standard multiplier
Building basic habits
Simple, concrete tasks
Appropriate for developmental stage

---

🦗 Cricket (Ages 9-12) - 1.2x
20% bonus on all points
Developing independence
Managing homework and activities
Increased responsibility rewarded

---

🪲 Stickbug (Ages 13-15) - 1.5x
50% bonus on all points
Juggling complex responsibilities
Long-term planning
Reflects increased demands

---

🦗 Mantis (Ages 16+) - 2.0x
100% bonus (double points!)
Adult-level workflows
High complexity and stakes
Appropriate challenge and reward

---

Why Age Multipliers Exist

Purpose:
Match task complexity to age
Ensure appropriate progression pace
Prevent younger users from getting discouraged
Challenge older users appropriately

Example comparison:
Same feat (Medium, 25 pts, Good quality, no streak):
Grasshopper: 25 × 1.0 = 25 points
Cricket: 25 × 1.2 = 30 points
Stickbug: 25 × 1.5 = 37 points (38 rounded)
Mantis: 25 × 2.0 = 50 points

Mantis earns double points for same feat! This reflects that adult tasks have higher complexity and stakes.

Complete Calculation Examples

Example 1: Basic Morning Routine

Feat Details:
Title: "Morning routine"
Difficulty: Medium (25 base points)
Quality: Good (1.0x)
Timeliness: N/A (not implemented)
Streak: 5 days (1.1x, +10%)
Age: Cricket (1.2x)

Calculation:
```
25 × 1.0 × 1.1 × 1.2 = 33 points
```

You earn: 33 points

---

Example 2: Excellent Study Session

Feat Details:
Title: "Study for history test"
Difficulty: Hard (50 base points)
Quality: Excellent (1.5x)
Timeliness: N/A
Streak: 14 days (1.3x, +30%)
Age: Stickbug (1.5x)

Calculation:
```
50 × 1.5 × 1.3 × 1.5 = 146.25 → 146 points
```

You earn: 146 points

Breakdown:
Base: 50 pts (Hard feat)
Quality bonus: +25 pts (Excellent 1.5x)
Streak bonus: +19 pts (14-day streak)
Age bonus: +52 pts (Stickbug 1.5x)
Total: 146 points!

---

Example 3: Struggled But Finished

Feat Details:
Title: "Complete essay"
Difficulty: Epic (100 base points)
Quality: Poor (0.5x) - "Distracted, barely finished"
Timeliness: N/A
Streak: 0 days (just starting)
Age: Mantis (2.0x)

Calculation:
```
100 × 0.5 × 1.0 × 2.0 = 100 points
```

You earn: 100 points

Important insight:
Even with "Poor" quality, you earned 100 points because:
Epic feat base (100 pts) × Mantis multiplier (2.0x) = 200 pts
Poor quality (0.5x) = 200 × 0.5 = 100 pts
You still get credit for finishing!

---

Example 4: Maximum Points Possible

Feat Details:
Title: "Deep work project milestone"
Difficulty: Epic (100 base points)
Quality: Excellent (1.5x)
Timeliness: Early - +20% (1.2x) [when implemented]
Streak: 30+ days (1.5x, +50% max)
Age: Mantis (2.0x)

Calculation (with future timeliness):
```
100 × 1.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 × 2.0 = 540 points
```

You would earn: 540 points for ONE feat!

Without timeliness (current):
```
100 × 1.5 × 1.5 × 2.0 = 450 points
```

You earn: 450 points

This is the power of:
High-difficulty feats (100 base)
Excellent quality (1.5x)
Long streaks (1.5x)
Age progression (2.0x)

Strategic Point Optimization

How to Maximize Points

1. Build and Maintain Streaks
✅ Complete at least 1 feat daily
✅ Reach 30+ days for maximum +50% bonus
✅ Use Grace Tokens to protect long streaks
✅ Streaks compound over time

Impact: 30-day streak = +50% points on every feat

---

2. Aim for "Good" Quality Consistently
✅ Good (1.0x) is your baseline
✅ Reserve "Excellent" for true excellence
✅ Be honest—builds self-awareness
✅ "Poor" still earns points!

Impact: Excellent quality = +50% points on that feat

---

3. Don't Avoid Hard/Epic Feats
✅ Hard feats = 50 pts (5× Easy feats)
✅ Epic feats = 100 pts (10× Easy feats)
✅ Use AI Breakdown to make them manageable
✅ Higher base = more points overall

Impact: 1 Epic feat = 10 Easy feats in base points

---

4. Leverage Your Age Multiplier
✅ Mantis (2.0x) earns double points

✅ Reduces stress

Impact (future): +20% for planning ahead

---

Common Point Scenarios

Daily Routine Example

Morning Routine (3 feats):
Make bed (Easy, 10 pts, Good) = 10 pts
Morning hygiene (Easy, 10 pts, Good) = 10 pts
Eat breakfast (Easy, 10 pts, Good) = 10 pts

Without streak or age multiplier: 30 points

With 7-day streak (1.2x) and Cricket age (1.2x):
```
30 × 1.2 × 1.2 = 43 points
```

+13 points just from consistency and age!

---

Homework Session Example

After-School Homework (2 feats):
Math homework (Medium, 25 pts, Good) = 25 pts
Reading assignment (Medium, 25 pts, Good) = 25 pts

Without streak or age: 50 points

With 14-day streak (1.3x) and Stickbug age (1.5x):
```
50 × 1.3 × 1.5 = 97.5 → 98 points
```

Nearly DOUBLE the base points!

---

Weekly Study Session Example

Epic Study Session:
Study for final exam (Epic, 100 pts, Excellent) = 100 pts

With 30-day streak (1.5x) and Mantis age (2.0x):
```
100 × 1.5 × 1.5 × 2.0 = 450 points
```

450 points for one epic session!
This is 3× Yellow Belt requirement (150 pts)
Advances you significantly toward next belt
One focused effort = major progress

Points Philosophy

What Points Represent

Not arbitrary:
Points measure consistent effort
Reflect task difficulty and quality
Reward discipline over time
Build toward tangible milestones (belts)

Points are:
✅ Feedback on your consistency
✅ Motivation to maintain streaks
✅ Recognition of effort and growth
✅ Path to belt progression

Points aren't:
❌ A measure of your worth
❌ Comparison with others
❌ About perfection
❌ The only thing that matters

---

Earning vs. Gaming

Earn points through:
✅ Genuine effort on real feats
✅ Honest quality self-assessment
✅ Consistent daily engagement
✅ Challenging yourself appropriately

Don't game points by:
❌ Creating fake "easy" feats
❌ Always rating "Excellent" undeservedly
❌ Avoiding meaningful work
❌ Cheating the system

Remember: You're building discipline and skills. Points are feedback, not the goal. The goal is mastering your focus and transforming overwhelm into action.

---

For Disciples: Points with Sensei Approval

How It Works

As a Disciple:
Complete feat → Request approval
Sensei reviews and rates quality
Points calculated with Sensei's quality rating
Points awarded when approved

Key difference:
You don't rate your own quality
Sensei rates quality based on their assessment
This builds accountability and feedback loop
Learn from Sensei's ratings over time

Example:
You think you did "Good" work
Sensei rates it "Excellent" with encouraging note
You earn Excellent points (1.5x)!
Sensei's assessment teaches you standards

---

Common Questions

Q: Do points expire?  
A: No! All points are permanent and count toward your total forever.

Q: Can I lose points?  
A: No. Once earned, points stay with you. You never go backward.

Q: What if I rate quality wrong?  
A: You can't change it after submitting. Choose thoughtfully, but don't stress—it's one feat of many.

Q: Do all feats earn the same base points?  
A: No. Easy = 10, Medium = 25, Hard = 50, Epic = 100. Choose difficulty thoughtfully!

Q: Can I see a history of points earned?  
A: View your profile for total points and belt progression history.

Q: Do streaks really make that big a difference?  
A: Yes! 30-day streak = +50% on every feat. It compounds massively over time.

Q: Why do older users earn more points?  
A: Age multipliers reflect increased task complexity and developmental stage. It's not "unfair"—it's appropriate challenge matching.
