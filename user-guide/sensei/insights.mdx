Sensei Insights

Overview

Sensei Insights is your data-driven dashboard for understanding each disciple's progress, identifying patterns, and providing targeted support. Instead of guessing what's working or struggling, you have analytics that show completion rates, quality trends, category performance, and time-of-day patterns.

Use Insights to support more effectively, not to judge or compare.

Completion Rate Analysis

What Completion Rate Tells You

Formula:
```
Completion Rate = (Completed Feats / Total Created Feats) × 100
```

Example:
Created: 50 feats
Completed: 40 feats
Rate: 80% ✅

---

Interpreting Completion Rate

90-100% - Possibly too easy
Feats may be too simple
Consider increasing difficulty
Or disciple is crushing it! 🎉

70-89% - Healthy range
Good balance of challenge
Most feats getting done
Some struggles are normal

50-69% - Needs attention
Something's blocking completion
Feats may be too hard or too many
Time to investigate

<50% - Intervention needed
Major struggles
Feats are overwhelming
Reduce volume or difficulty
Have conversation with disciple

---

Improving Low Completion Rates

Common causes:
Too many feats created
Feats too difficult
Disciple overwhelmed
Lost motivation
External life challenges

Solutions:

Reduce volume:
Delete incomplete old feats
Create fewer new feats
Focus on 3-5 essential daily feats

Lower difficulty:
Break Hard feats into Medium/Easy
Use AI Breakdown
Simplify feat descriptions

Increase support:
Check in more frequently
Celebrate small wins
Problem-solve together
Use Focus Timer for structure

---

Quality Trends

Average Quality Over Time

Chart shows:
Quality ratings over last 30 days
Trend line: improving, stable, or declining
Daily/weekly averages

What to look for:

Improving trend ↗️
Disciple is building skills
Getting better at focus
Celebrate this growth!

Stable trend ➡️
Consistent performance
Established baseline
Normal and healthy

Declining trend ↘️
Something's wrong
Burnout? Overwhelm?
Life challenges?
Time to check in

---

Quality Distribution

Pie chart or bar graph shows:
% rated Excellent
% rated Good
% rated Fair
% rated Poor

Healthy distribution:
60-70% Good
15-20% Fair
10-15% Excellent
<10% Poor

Red flags:
>30% Poor - Something's very wrong
>50% Excellent - You might be too generous
100% of any one rating - Lacks nuance

---

Using Quality Data

If mostly Poor/Fair:
Feats are too hard
Disciple is struggling
Need more scaffolding
Break down tasks more
Check for external issues

If mostly Excellent:
Feats might be too easy
You might be rating too generously
Consider increasing challenge
Or disciple is truly excelling!

Stable Good ratings:
Perfect! This is the goal
Consistent baseline
Occasional Fair and Excellent is normal

---

Category Performance

Tasks by Category

Shows completion count per category:
☀️ Morning: 25 completed
📚 School: 15 completed
☀️ After-school: 30 completed
🌙 Nighttime: 20 completed

What this reveals:

Balanced completion:
All categories roughly equal
Well-rounded discipline
Healthy routine

One category dominates:
May indicate focus area
Or other categories neglected
Check if intentional

One category very low:
Struggling with that time of day
May need more support
Adjust feats or timing

---

Category-Specific Insights

Morning feats low:
Hard time waking up?
Rushing in morning?
Too many morning feats?
Solution: Simplify morning routine, set earlier alarm

School feats low:
Not tracking school tasks?
School overwhelming?
Resistance to academic work?
Solution: Break down assignments, use Focus Timer

After-school feats low:
Post-school crash?
Too tired for homework?
Extracurriculars taking time?
Solution: Built in transition time, reduce feat count

Nighttime feats low:
Bedtime resistance?
Evening exhaustion?
Forgetting nighttime routine?
Solution: Earlier bedtime feats, consistent timing, reminders

---

Time of Day Patterns

When Disciple is Most Active

Shows completion times:
🌅 Morning (6am-12pm): 30%
☀️ Afternoon (12pm-5pm): 40%
🌆 Evening (5pm-9pm): 25%
🌙 Night (9pm-12am): 5%

What this reveals:

Strong afternoon performance:
Most productive after school
Good time for homework feats
Schedule hard feats then

Weak morning performance:
Mornings are struggle time
Keep morning feats simple
Consider later wake time

Late night completions:
Procrastination pattern?
Or natural night owl?
Adjust expectations or feat timing

---

Using Time Patterns

Schedule feats strategically:
Put hard feats during peak times
Easy feats during struggle times
Match feat difficulty to energy levels

Example:
Morning (low energy): Easy feats only
After-school (high energy): Hard homework feats
Evening (moderate): Medium chores/prep
Nighttime (low): Simple bedtime routine

---

Streak History

Streak Visualization

Calendar heatmap shows:
✅ Days with completions (green)
❌ Days without completions (gray)
🔥 Current active streak
📊 Longest streak ever

Example:
```
Week 1: ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ ✅ ✅ ✅ = 3-day streak broke, restarted
Week 2: ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ = 7-day streak!
Week 3: ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ ✅ = 5-day streak broke
Week 4: ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ (ongoing) = 4-day current streak
```

---

Identifying Patterns

Look for:

Weekend drops:
Consistent missed weekends
Less structure on weekends
Solution: Create weekend-specific feats, maintain routine

Mid-week slumps:
Wednesday/Thursday drops
Fatigue accumulating
Solution: Lighter feats mid-week, build in breaks

Monday struggles:
Hard to restart after weekend
Transition difficulty
Solution: Simple Monday feats, ease back in

Consistent long streaks:
Excellent discipline!
Celebrate this!
Possible Grace Token use

---

Insights-Driven Actions

What to Do with Insights

If completion rate is low:
Review current feats
Delete old incomplete feats
Reduce daily feat count
Simplify difficult feats
Have check-in conversation

If quality is declining:
Check for burnout/overwhelm
Ask about external stressors
Reduce difficulty temporarily
Celebrate effort, not just results
Consider break from system

If one category struggles:
Focus support on that category
Break down feats in that category
Use Focus Timer for those feats
Adjust timing of those feats
Reduce feat count in that category

If streaks keep breaking:
Set up daily reminders
Simplify to one "easy win" feat
Explain Grace Token usage
Check if feat timing realistic
Consider if pressure is helpful

---

Red Flags to Watch For

Warning Signs

Sudden drops:
Completion rate drops 20%+ in a week
Quality drops significantly
Active streak breaks after long run
Action: Check in immediately, something changed

Complete disengagement:
No activity for 3+ days
Multiple pending approvals ignored
Zero responses to your notes
Action: Direct conversation, assess if system is helping

Gaming patterns:
Only completing Easy feats
Fake completions (you caught them)
Always self-rating Excellent
Action: Address honesty, refocus on growth

Burnout signals:
Quality declining steadily
Completion rate dropping
Shortened notes from disciple
Action: Reduce pressure, possibly take break

---

Comparing Disciples

When Comparison Helps

Use comparison to:
✅ Identify if feat difficulty is appropriate
✅ See if your approval patterns are consistent
✅ Spot systemic issues (all disciples struggling = you)
✅ Benchmark realistic expectations

Don't use comparison to:
❌ Judge which disciple is "better"
❌ Create competition between disciples
❌ Shame lower performers
❌ Play favorites

---

Healthy Comparison

Example insight:

"All three disciples struggle with After-school feats. This isn't individual issue—it's category issue. Maybe After-school expectations are too high across the board."

Action: Reduce After-school feat count for everyone.

---

Bad comparison:

"Jordan has 80% completion rate and Alex only has 60%. Alex is lazy."

Wrong approach! Each disciple has different challenges, capabilities, and circumstances.

---

Insights Limitations

What Insights Can't Tell You

Remember:
❌ Insights show correlation, not causation
❌ Can't capture external life factors
❌ Don't show emotional state
❌ Can't replace conversation

Always combine:
✅ Data from Insights
✅ Direct conversation with disciple
✅ Your observations
✅ Context from their life

---

When to Ignore Metrics

Sometimes low numbers are okay:
Disciple is sick
Family emergency
Testing week (overwhelmed)
Vacation/travel
Starting new routine (learning curve)

Don't:
Punish for low metrics
Pressure for perfect stats
Obsess over numbers
Lose sight of human

Insights are tools, not weapons.

---

Best Practices

Do's

✅ Check Insights weekly - Spot trends early  
✅ Look for patterns - Not just single data points  
✅ Combine with conversation - Data + dialogue  
✅ Celebrate improvements - Show disciple their progress  
✅ Adjust based on data - Be responsive  
✅ Share relevant insights - "Look, your quality is improving!"

Don'ts

❌ Don't obsess over metrics - They're guides, not goals  
❌ Don't compare disciples publicly - Each journey is unique  
❌ Don't punish low numbers - Understand causes first  
❌ Don't ignore red flags - Data shows what conversation can't  
❌ Don't use Insights to shame - Use to support  
❌ Don't make it all about numbers - Relationship matters more

---

Sharing Insights with Disciples

When to Show Disciples Their Data

Good times:
Celebrating improvements
Identifying patterns together
Setting goals collaboratively
Building self-awareness

Example:
>
 "Look at this graph! Your quality ratings have gone up every week this month. You're building real skills!"

---

When NOT to Share

Avoid showing:
When shaming for low numbers
To create guilt
To compare with siblings
When metrics are declining (unless discussing supportively)

Better approach for declining metrics:
>
 "I've noticed completing feats has been harder this week. What's going on? How can I help?"

(You looked at Insights, but lead with empathy, not data dump)

---

Common Questions

Q: How often should I check Insights?  
A: Weekly check-in is ideal. Daily is too much, monthly misses patterns.

Q: What's the most important metric?  
A: No single metric. Look at the full picture—completion rate, quality, streaks together.

Q: Should I share Insights with my disciple?  
A: Selectively. Show positive trends to celebrate. Discuss struggles empathetically.

Q: Can disciples see their own Insights?  
A: Not currently. This is a Sensei-only tool. Future may add disciple-facing analytics.

Q: What if all metrics are bad?  
A: Time for serious conversation. Maybe Task Dojo isn't the right fit right now, or major adjustments needed.

Q: Do Insights work with just a few completed feats?  
A: Sort of. More data = better insights. Need at least 10-20 completions for meaningful patterns.
