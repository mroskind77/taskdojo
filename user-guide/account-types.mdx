Choosing Your Account Type

During Onboarding

When you first set up Task Dojo, you'll choose your account type. Here's how to decide:

Ask yourself:
Do you need someone to check your work? → Choose Disciple
Are you helping others manage tasks? → Choose Sensei  
Are you ready to work independently? → Choose Master

Remember: 
You're not locked into your choice forever
The goal is to match where you are right now
Disciples can graduate to Masters as they build skills
Senseis can manage multiple disciples

The Sensei-Disciple Relationship

How It Works

Sensei creates a Disciple account
Set up profile, age category, and starting avatar
Customize initial feat templates

Disciple completes feats
Work through tasks during the day
Mark feats complete when done
Add notes about what went well or was challenging

Sensei reviews and approves
See all pending completions in one view
Rate quality (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)
Add encouraging notes and feedback
Approve or provide guidance for improvement

Disciple earns points and advances
Points awarded after approval
Belt progression continues
Achievements unlock
Confidence builds

Privacy & Data

For Disciples:
Your Sensei can see your tasks, completions, and progress
Only your assigned Sensei has access to your data
You can discuss with your Sensei about privacy preferences

For Senseis:
You see only disciples you've created or been granted access to
All data is private and not shared with others
Your disciples trust you with their progress—honor that responsibility

---

Switching Account Types

Can I Change Later?

Disciples → Masters:
When you're ready for independence, your Sensei can help you transition
(Feature planned for future updates)

Masters ↔ Senseis:
Masters can become Senseis by adding disciples
Senseis maintain their own Master progress alongside disciples

Current Limitations:
Account type is set during onboarding
Contact support if you need to change account types

Common Questions

Q: Can one person have both Master and Disciple accounts?  
A: Not currently. Each account is one type. However, Senseis maintain their own Master progress while managing disciples.

Q: How many disciples can a Sensei manage?  
A: There's no hard limit, but we recommend focusing on quality feedback for 1-5 disciples.

Q: Do disciples need their own email?  
A: Senseis create disciple accounts, so disciples don't need their own email addresses.

Q: Can disciples see other disciples' progress?  
A: No. Each disciple only sees their own progress.

Q: What if I don't have someone to be my Sensei?  
A: Choose Master! The system works great for independent users too.
