Onboarding Guide

Welcome to Task Dojo

Your Task Dojo journey begins with a thoughtful 4-step onboarding process designed to set you up for success. We know planning can feel impossible—that's OK. We're here to support your brain, one step at a time.

The 4-Step Onboarding Flow

Step 1: Choose Your Account Type

What You'll See:
Three account type options: Master, Sensei, or Disciple
Clear descriptions of each type
Visual icons for each role

Your Decision:

🥋 Master - "I work best independently"
Choose this if you want full control over your feats
Complete and rate your own work
No approval needed

🎓 Sensei - "I'm here to guide others"
Choose this if you're a parent, teacher, or mentor
Create accounts for disciples
Approve completions and provide feedback

🌱 Disciple - "I benefit from guidance"
Choose this if you're learning with support
Complete feats and request approval
Build independence with accountability

Empathetic Context:
"Struggling to start? This tool is designed for that. Choose the path that fits your needs."

Pro Tip:
Not sure? Most people start with Master to try it out
Parents setting up for kids should choose Sensei
Kids with parental support should have Sensei create their Disciple account

---

Step 2: Select Your Age Category

What You'll See:
Four age categories with clear descriptions
Point multipliers explained
Age ranges for guidance

The Categories:

🦗 Grasshopper (Ages 5-8)
Simple, concrete feats
1.0x point multiplier
Building basic routines

🦗 Cricket (Ages 9-12)
Developing independence
1.2x point multiplier
Managing homework and activities

🪲 Stickbug (Ages 13-15)
Mastering complexity
1.5x point multiplier
Juggling multiple responsibilities

🦗 Mantis (Ages 16+)
Full autonomy
2.0x point multiplier
Adult-level workflows

Why This Matters:
Your age category adjusts:
Point earning rate
Belt progression pace
Preset feat templates
Suggested feat complexity

Be Honest:
Choose the category that matches your current developmental stage. This ensures the system supports you appropriately.

Step 3: Choose Your Avatar

What You'll See:
Grid of 16 unique avatar skins
Visual preview of each option
Lock icons on locked avatars
"Selected" indicator on your choice

Default Unlocked Avatars (4):
Everyone starts with 4 avatars available immediately:
🥋 Classic Dojo Master
🌟 Bright Beginner
🎨 Creative Spirit
🦁 Bold Lion

Locked Avatars (12):
These unlock as you progress:
Belt Milestones: Earn Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown belts
Streak Achievements: Maintain 7-day, 14-day, 30-day streaks
Completion Counts: Complete 50, 100, 250 feats
Special Achievements: Perfect week, quality master, category champion

Why Avatars Matter:
Makes your progress tangible
Gives you something to work toward
Personalizes your experience
Unlocking new avatars celebrates achievements

Choosing Your First Avatar:
Pick one of the 4 unlocked avatars that resonates with you. You can change it later in Settings, and you'll unlock more as you progress.

Step 4: Complete Your Profile

What You'll Enter:

Display Name (Required):
What you want to be called in Task Dojo
Examples: "Alex," "Dragon Warrior," "Study Ninja"
This appears in your dashboard and celebrations

Optional Information:
Depending on your account type, you may also set:
Email (for account recovery)
Password (if creating independent account)
Time zone (for streak tracking)

For Disciples:
Your Sensei completes this step when creating your account, so you'll skip directly to your dashboard.

Completion Message:
"You're all set! Let's start building your discipline, one feat at a time."

Onboarding for Different Account Types

Master Onboarding

Full 4-Step Process:
✅ Choose Master account type
✅ Select age category
✅ Pick starting avatar
✅ Enter display name

After Completion:
Dashboard with empty feat list
Access to Template Library
All Master features unlocked
Tutorial tooltips (optional)

First Action:
Create your first feat or browse templates to get started.

---

Sensei Onboarding

Full 4-Step Process (For Your Own Account):
✅ Choose Sensei account type
✅ Select age category
✅ Pick starting avatar
✅ Enter display name

After Completion:
Dashboard with your own feats
Plus: Disciple management section
Button to "Add New Disciple"
Insights panel for disciples

First Action:
Decide if you want to:
Set up your own feats first (model good habits!)
Create your first disciple account
Both!

Creating a Disciple:
From your dashboard, click "Add New Disciple" and complete the 4-step flow for them:
Confirm Disciple account type
Select their age category
Choose their starting avatar
Set their display name

---

Disciple Onboarding

Simplified Process (Sensei-Created):
Disciples don't go through onboarding themselves. Instead:

Sensei Creates Account:
Sensei completes 4-step setup
Sensei can pre-populate feats from templates
Sensei sets initial preferences

Disciple First Login:
Goes directly to dashboard
Sees any feats Sensei created
Brief welcome message
Ready to start working!

Why This Works:
Reduces friction for younger users or those who struggle with setup. Sensei handles configuration.

Onboarding Best Practices

For All Users

✅ Take your time - Onboarding is short (2-3 minutes) but thoughtful  
✅ Be honest about age category - It affects your entire experience  
✅ Choose an avatar you like - You'll see it every day!  
✅ Read the account type descriptions - Make sure you choose right

❌ Don't rush - A few extra seconds here saves confusion later  
❌ Don't skip reading - Understanding your choice helps you succeed  
❌ Don't worry about "wrong" choices - You can adjust most settings later

---

For Senseis

✅ Set up your own account first - Model the behavior you want disciples to see  
✅ Involve your disciple in avatar choice - If they're present, let them pick  
✅ Start with 1-2 preset templates - Don't overwhelm with too many initial feats  
✅ Explain the system to your disciple - Help them understand how approval works

❌ Don't create too many disciples at once - Start with 1-2 to learn the system  
❌ Don't pre-fill too many feats - Let disciples have some agency  
❌ Don't choose age category based on grade - Use developmental stage

---

For Parents Setting Up for Kids

✅ Create a Sensei account for yourself  
✅ Then create Disciple accounts for each child  
✅ Let kids choose their avatars (from the 4 unlocked options)  
✅ Explain to kids how approval works before they start  
✅ Set expectations about review timing - "I'll check before bed each day"

Pro Tip:
Do the first feat completion and approval together so your child sees the full workflow.

Technical Notes

Account Creation

Email Requirements:
Masters: Need their own email
Senseis: Need their own email
Disciples: Use Sensei's email (sub-accounts)

Email Confirmation:
Email confirmation is automatically approved since an email server hasn't been configured. You can sign in immediately.

Password Requirements:
Minimum 6 characters (recommended: 8+)
No special character requirements
Should be memorable for Disciples (Senseis can reset)

---

Any identifying information

For Disciples:
All data is private to you and your Sensei. Other disciples cannot see your information.

Troubleshooting Onboarding

Common Issues

"I don't know which account type to choose"
Independent user? → Master
Helping someone else? → Sensei
Being helped by someone? → Ask them to create you as Disciple

"I'm not sure about my age category"
Choose based on developmental stage, not just age
When in doubt, choose the category that matches your age
You can contact support to change it later

"I can't decide on an avatar"
Just pick one! You can change it anytime in Settings
You'll unlock 12 more as you progress
Your first avatar doesn't lock you in

"The onboarding seems too simple"
That's intentional! We want you in the app quickly
Complexity comes gradually as you use features
Tutorial tooltips guide you through advanced features

"I clicked the wrong account type"
Contact support to reset your account
Or create a new account with a different email
(Account type switching in-app is planned for future)
