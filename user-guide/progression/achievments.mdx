Achievement Philosophy

What Achievements Represent

Not just badges:
Real milestones of discipline
Diverse forms of success
Recognition of effort
Motivation to continue

Achievements celebrate:
✅ Consistency (streaks)
✅ Volume (completion count)
✅ Quality (excellent work)
✅ Balance (all categories)
✅ Features (using tools)
✅ Progress (belt advancement)

Why variety matters:
Not everyone progresses the same way. Some users:
Maintain long streaks but fewer completions
Complete many feats but shorter streaks
Excel in specific categories
Use features differently

Achievements recognize all paths to discipline.
