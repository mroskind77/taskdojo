Creating Feats

Overview

In Task Dojo, we call tasks "feats" because every accomplishment—no matter how small—is an achievement worth celebrating. Creating feats that work for your brain is the foundation of building discipline and mastering your focus.

What Makes a Good Feat?

The SMART-ish Approach

You don't need perfect task creation. But feats work best when they're:

✅ Specific - "Study math" → "Complete Chapter 3 practice problems"  
✅ Measurable - You know when it's done  
✅ Actionable - Starts with a verb (Do, Complete, Practice, Review)  
✅ Right-sized - Not too big, not too small (use AI Breakdown for big ones!)  
✅ Time-aware - Belongs to a category (Morning, School, After-school, Nighttime)

Remember: Done is better than perfect. Create the feat, adjust as you learn.

How to Create a Feat

Method 1: Quick Create (Custom Feat)

Steps:

Click "Add Feat" button (usually top right or in feat list)

Fill in the details:
Title (Required): What are you doing?
Examples: "Morning routine," "Math homework," "Clean room"
Category (Required): When will you do this?
Morning ☀️ | School 📚 | After-school ☀️ | Nighttime 🌙
Difficulty (Required): How challenging is this?
Easy (10 pts) | Medium (25 pts) | Hard (50 pts) | Epic (100 pts)
Description (Optional): Any details or reminders
Due Date (Optional): When should this be completed?

Click "Create Feat"

Feat appears in your list!

Time to create: 30-60 seconds

Time to create: 2-3 minutes for a full routine

Pro Tip: Templates are starting points. Customize them to match your actual routine!

---

Feat Details Explained

Title

What it is: The name of your feat—what you'll see in your list.

Best practices:
Start with an action verb: "Complete," "Practice," "Review," "Organize"
Be specific enough to know what you mean
Keep it short (2-6 words ideal)

Examples:
✅ "Complete math worksheet"
✅ "Practice piano 20 minutes"
✅ "Put away laundry"
❌ "Stuff" (too vague)
❌ "Complete all homework assignments for the week and organize my binder and also study for Friday's test" (too long!)

---

Category

What it is: When during the day you'll do this feat.

The Four Categories:

☀️ Morning (Sunrise icon)
Tasks you do before school/work
Routines to start your day
Examples: Wake up routine, breakfast, pack bag

📚 School (Book icon)
Tasks during school/work hours
Academic responsibilities
Examples: Attend class, take notes, participate

☀️ After-school (Sun icon)
Tasks after school/work until evening
Homework, activities, chores
Examples: Homework, sports practice, chores

🌙 Nighttime (Moon icon)
Evening wind-down and prep for tomorrow
Bedtime routines
Examples: Shower, pack tomorrow's bag, bedtime routine

Why categories matter:
Help you filter feats by time of day
Organize your dashboard visually
Support time awareness and planning
Unlock category-specific achievements

Filtering: Click a category icon to show only feats from that category.

---

Difficulty (Points)

What it is: How challenging the feat is, which determines base points earned.

The Four Difficulty Levels:

Easy - 10 points
Takes <10 minutes
Simple, single-step tasks
Low cognitive load
Examples: "Brush teeth," "Make bed," "Check email"

Medium - 25 points
Takes 10-30 minutes
Multi-step or moderate effort
Some planning needed
Examples: "Morning routine," "Clean desk," "Practice instrument"

Hard - 50 points
Takes 30-60 minutes
Complex or requires focus
Multiple steps or decisions
Examples: "Complete homework set," "Deep work session," "Organize closet"

Epic - 100 points
Takes 60+ minutes
Very complex or high-stakes
Major accomplishment
Examples: "Study for exam (2 hours)," "Complete project," "Deep clean room"

Choosing difficulty:
Be honest - Difficulty affects points but not your worth
Consider time AND effort - Mental energy counts too
Start conservative - You can always break down Epic feats later

Special Rule: Feats >50 points
If you create a feat with Hard or Epic difficulty, Task Dojo will suggest using AI Breakdown to split it into smaller sub-feats. This helps prevent overwhelm!

---

Description (Optional)

What it is: Extra details, reminders, or context for your feat.

When to use:
Clarify what "done" means
List specific requirements
Add motivational reminders
Note materials needed

Examples:
"Complete pages 45-52, show work"
"Remember to bring notebook and pencil"
"This is for Friday's presentation"
"You did great last time—you've got this!"

When to skip:
Title is self-explanatory
Simple, routine feats
You want to keep things minimal

---

Due Date (Optional)

What it is: When the feat should be completed.

Current behavior:
Sets a target date
Helps with planning
Note: Timeliness bonuses/penalties not yet implemented (coming soon!)

When to use:
Time-sensitive feats (homework due dates, appointments)
Building toward a deadline
Planning ahead

When to skip:
Recurring daily feats (morning routine)
Flexible timing
You prefer spontaneous completion

---

Using AI Feat Breakdown

What It Is

AI Feat Breakdown helps you turn a big, overwhelming feat into smaller, actionable sub-feats. It's like having a planning coach in your pocket.

Research evidence: 58% of users need help breaking down tasks >5 points. This tool provides that scaffolding.

---

When to Use AI Breakdown

Automatic suggestion:
When you create a feat with Hard (50 pts) or Epic (100 pts) difficulty, you'll see:

>
 "Big tasks work better when broken down. Let's make it doable!"

Manual use:
You can also break down any existing feat by:
Clicking the feat
Selecting "Break Down This Feat"
Using AI to generate sub-feats

---

How It Works

Steps:

Create a feat with high difficulty (or select existing feat to break down)

Click "Generate Steps Now" in the breakdown modal

AI analyzes your feat:
Reads the title
Considers difficulty/points
Applies task decomposition logic

AI generates 3-7 sub-feats:
Each is smaller and more actionable
Automatically assigned appropriate points
Sequenced in logical order

Review the suggestions:
Edit any sub-feat titles
Adjust points if needed
Reorder steps
Delete any you don't need
Add extras manually

Click "Create Sub-Feats"

Original feat becomes a checklist:
Each sub-feat appears as a checkbox
Complete them one at a time
Check off as you go
Feel progress with each check!

---

Example: AI Breakdown in Action

Original Feat:
Title: "Study for history test"
Difficulty: Epic (100 pts)
Status: Feels overwhelming 😰

After AI Breakdown:
✅ Review Chapter 7 notes (10 pts)
✅ Create timeline of key events (15 pts)
✅ Make flashcards for vocabulary (15 pts)
✅ Practice timeline from memory (20 pts)
✅ Review flashcards with someone (20 pts)
✅ Take practice quiz (20 pts)

Total: Still 100 points, but now doable!

Psychological benefit:
Each sub-feat is achievable
Checking boxes provides dopamine hits
Progress feels tangible
Starting becomes possible

Your brain: "I can review Chapter 7 notes. Let's start there." ✅

---

AI Breakdown Best Practices

✅ Use it for feats that feel paralyzing - If you can't start, break it down  
✅ Review and customize suggestions - AI is smart, but you know your needs  
✅ Complete sub-feats in order - AI sequences them logically  
✅ Celebrate each checkbox - Small wins build momentum  
✅ Adjust points if needed - Make sub-feats match actual effort

❌ Don't break down simple feats - "Brush teeth" doesn't need 3 steps  
❌ Don't over-analyze - If AI's suggestions are 80% right, go with it  
❌ Don't skip steps - Each one builds toward the whole

Tips for Creating Effective Feats

Start Small

Why: Building the habit of creating and completing feats is more important than creating the "perfect" feat.

How:
First week: Create 2-3 simple, recurring feats
Build from there as you get comfortable
Add complexity gradually

---

Use Consistent Naming

Why: Makes your feat list scannable and reduces cognitive load.

How:
Use similar structures: "Complete [subject] homework"
Group related feats: "Morning: [action]"
Consistent verbs: Always "Practice" for music, "Review" for studying

---

Make "Done" Clear

Why: Ambiguity prevents completion and causes stress.

How:
✅ "Complete math worksheet (pages 12-15)"
✅ "Practice piano: scales + one song"
❌ "Do some homework" (vague!)
❌ "Work on project" (no definition of done!)

---

Balance Difficulty

Why: Too many Epic feats = overwhelm. Too many Easy feats = slow progress.

Sweet spot:
60-70% Easy/Medium (daily maintenance)
20-30% Hard (meaningful progress)
5-10% Epic (major accomplishments)

Example daily list:
3-4 Easy feats (morning routine, quick tasks)
2-3 Medium feats (homework, chores)
1 Hard feat (study session, project work)
0-1 Epic feat (only if you have time!)

---

Create Feats in Batches

Why: Reduces decision fatigue and planning time.

How:
Sunday evening: Create all week's feats
Monthly: Set up recurring templates
Seasonally: Adjust for schedule changes

Don't overthink: You can always add/delete feats throughout the week.

---

Common Feat Creation Mistakes

Mistake #1: Feats Too Big

Problem: "Complete all homework" is overwhelming.

Solution: Break it down:
"Complete math homework"
"Read history chapter"
"Practice Spanish vocab"

Or use: AI Feat Breakdown!

---

Mistake #2: Feats Too Vague

Problem: "Be productive" doesn't tell you what to do.

Solution: Make it specific:
"Write 500 words for essay"
"Answer client emails"
"Organize desk drawer"

---

Mistake #3: Too Many Feats

Problem: Creating 20 feats for tomorrow sets you up for failure.

Solution: Start with 3-5 essential feats. Add more only if you finish these.

Remember: Completing 3/3 feels better than completing 5/20.

---

Mistake #4: Perfectionism

Problem: Spending 10 minutes crafting the perfect feat title.

Solution: Create it in 30 seconds. Adjust later if needed. Action > perfection.

---

Mistake #5: Forgetting Categories

Problem: All feats are uncategorized chaos.

Solution: Always assign Morning, School, After-school, or Nighttime. Helps with time awareness!

---

For Disciples: Creating Feats with Sensei Support

How It Works

As a Disciple, you can create your own feats! Your Sensei doesn't have to create everything for you.

Process:
You create a feat (same process as above)
Feat appears in your list immediately
When you complete it, you request approval
Sensei reviews and approves (or provides feedback)
You earn points after approval

Sensei can also:
Create feats for you (appears in your list)
Suggest templates
Help you break down big feats

---

Tips for Disciples

✅ Create feats you genuinely want to do - Not just what you think Sensei wants  
✅ Ask Sensei for help with big feats - Use AI Breakdown together  
✅ Be specific - Helps Sensei understand what you did when approving  
✅ Use templates - Especially when starting out

❌ Don't create fake easy feats - Sensei will notice!  
❌ Don't wait for Sensei to create everything - Show initiative  
❌ Don't be afraid to adjust - If a feat doesn't work, delete and remake it

---

For Senseis: Creating Feats for Disciples

Best Practices

✅ Start with 1-2 templates - Don't overwhelm with 20 initial feats  
✅ Involve your disciple - Ask what feats would help them  
✅ Use age-appropriate templates - Let the system guide difficulty  
✅ Leave room for their creativity - Don't pre-fill everything  
✅ Model good feat creation - Create your own feats too!

Creating feats for disciples:
Go to Disciple's profile
Click "Add Feat for [Name]"
Fill in details (same form as your own feats)
Feat appears in their list

Collaborative creation:
Do the first few together
Show them how to use templates
Explain difficulty levels
Demonstrate AI Breakdown
