Managing Disciples

Overview

As a Sensei, managing disciples involves creating their accounts, organizing their progress, and providing the structure they need to build executive function skills. This guide covers everything from creating new disciple accounts to organizing multiple disciples effectively.

Creating Disciple Accounts

The Creation Process

When to create a disciple account:
Setting up Task Dojo for your child
Onboarding a student you're mentoring
Adding a family member who needs guidance
Taking on a new mentee

---

Step-by-Step: Create New Disciple

From your Sensei dashboard:

Click "Create Disciple" button
Usually purple/prominent button
Opens creation dialog

Fill in disciple information:

   Name (Required)
What they'll be called in Task Dojo
Their first name is fine
Display name they'll see
Examples: "Alex," "Jordan," "Emma"

   Email (Required)
Can use YOUR email + alias
Example: `youremail+alex@gmail.com`
Disciple doesn't need their own email
Used for account management only

   Password (Required)
Minimum 6 characters (8+ recommended)
Something disciple can remember
You should know it (to help them log in)
Can be simple for young disciples

   Age Category (Required)
Choose developmental stage:
Grasshopper (5-8)
Cricket (9-12)
Stickbug (13-15)
Mantis (16+)
Affects point multipliers and templates
Choose based on maturity, not just age

Click "Create Account"
Account created immediately
Email confirmation auto-approved
Disciple appears in your disciple list

Initial setup (optional):
Choose their starting avatar (from 5 defaults)
Add initial feats from templates
Set up first routines

Time to create: 2-3 minutes per disciple

---

Post-Creation Steps

After creating the account:

Choose starting avatar
Pick from 5 default options
Best practice: Let disciple choose if present!
Can change anytime later

Add initial feats (optional)
Use Template Library
Choose age-appropriate routines
Start with 3-5 simple feats
Don't overwhelm with 20 feats on day 1!

Explain the system to your disciple
Show them the dashboard
Walk through completing a feat
Demonstrate approval process
Set expectations for review timing

Do the first approval together
Have them complete one feat
Approve it in front of them
Show them the celebration
Explain quality ratings

---

Disciple List Overview

What You See

Your Disciples dashboard shows:

For each disciple:
👤 Name and avatar
🥋 Current belt level
📊 Total points
🔥 Current streak
⏳ Pending approvals count
📅 Last activity

Example disciple card:
```
👤 Alex
🦗 Cricket | 🟡 Yellow Belt
Points: 178 | Streak: 12 days
⏳ 3 feats pending approval
Last active: 2 hours ago
```

---

Sorting and Filtering

Organization options:

Sort by:
Pending approvals (most urgent first)
Last activity (recently active first)
Name (alphabetical)
Belt level (highest first)
Streak (longest first)

Filter by:
Has pending approvals
Active this week
Inactive (not active in 3+ days)
All disciples

Use case: 
Morning: Sort by pending approvals, handle reviews
Evening: Check who hasn't been active today

---

Organizing Multiple Disciples

Best Practices for 2+ Disciples

Create predictable routines:
Review approvals same time daily
Example: "I check Task Dojo after dinner"
Communicate this schedule to disciples
Consistency builds trust

Batch approvals by time:
Set aside 10-15 minutes
Review all pending approvals at once
More efficient than scattered throughout day
Reduces context switching

Prioritize urgent items:
Disciples with broken streaks
Overdue approvals (>24 hours old)
Disciples who are struggling
New disciples learning system

Use Insights to identify needs:
Who needs more support?
Who's thriving independently?
Where are patterns emerging?
Adjust support accordingly

---

Managing 1-2 Disciples

Ideal starting point:

Advantages:
✅ Can provide detailed, personalized feedback
✅ Less time pressure
✅ Learn the Sensei role thoroughly
✅ Build strong relationships

Time commitment:
~5-10 minutes per day
Daily approval reviews
Occasional deeper check-ins

Strategy:
Review approvals once daily
Write thoughtful notes on each
Have weekly check-in conversations
Adjust feats based on progress

---

Managing 3-5 Disciples

Sweet spot for experienced Senseis:

Challenges:
More approvals to review
Need efficient systems
Risk of less personal feedback
Requires discipline

Time commitment:
~15-25 minutes per day
Batch approval sessions
Weekly individual check-ins

Strategy:
Set specific review times
Use note templates for efficiency
Still personalize each note
Focus on quality over quantity
Use Insights to spot issues early

---

Managing 6+ Disciples

Advanced Sensei territory:

Challenges:
⚠️ Risk of burnout
⚠️ Less personal feedback
⚠️ Longer approval delays
⚠️ Harder to track individuals

Time commitment:
~30-45 minutes per day
Multiple batch sessions
May need to delegate

Only recommended if:
You're an experienced Sensei
You have efficient systems
You can maintain quality feedback
You have time capacity

Consider:
Multiple Sensei accounts (family members help)
Reducing number of disciples
Grouping by household/class
Using Insights heavily

---

---

Adding Feats for Disciples

When Senseis Create Feats

You can create feats directly in disciple's list:

When to create for them:
Initial setup (first routines)
They're too young to create own
Introducing new routine
Specific assignment you want them to do

When to let them create:
They're old enough (9+)
Building independence
They have ideas
Encouraging initiative

Balance: Start by creating most feats, gradually shift to disciple creating their own.

---

Click "Add Feat for [Name]"
Fill in feat details:
Title

Click "Create"
Feat appears in disciple's list
They see it immediately
Can complete and request approval

---

Using Templates for Disciples

Template Library is powerful:

Steps:

---

Monitoring Disciple Activity

Activity Indicators

Recent activity:
Last login time
Last feat completed
Last approval requested
Days since last activity

Warning signs:
🔴 No activity in 3+ days
🔴 Streak about to break
🔴 Multiple pending approvals unapproved
🔴 Completion rate dropping

Positive indicators:
🟢 Daily completions
🟢 Long active streak
🟢 Creating own feats
🟢 Improving quality ratings

---

Proactive Check-Ins

When to reach out:

If disciple is inactive:
Haven't logged in for 2-3 days
Message: "Hey! Haven't seen you in Task Dojo. Everything okay?"
Understand barriers, don't punish

If completions are declining:
Used to complete 3-5 feats/day, now 0-1
Check in about overwhelm
Reduce feats if needed

If quality is consistently poor:
Multiple "Poor" ratings in a row
Something might be wrong
Discuss challenges, adjust difficulty

Celebrate improvements:
Notice positive trends
"You've completed all morning feats for a week!"
Positive reinforcement matters

---

Transitioning Disciples to Independence

Signs of Readiness

Disciple may be ready for more independence when:

Creating feats:
✅ Creates most of their own feats
✅ Uses appropriate difficulty levels
✅ Feats are realistic and achievable
✅ Asks for help breaking down big feats

Self-assessment:
✅ Quality ratings are honest
✅ Rarely games the system
✅ Accepts feedback gracefully
✅ Adjusts based on notes

Consistency:
✅ Maintains streaks without reminders
✅ Logs in daily independently
✅ Completes most planned feats
✅ Uses tools (Timer, Breakdown)

Age/maturity:
✅ Typically 14+ years old
✅ Demonstrates executive function growth
✅ Wants more autonomy

---

Gradual Independence Path

Phase 1: Highly Guided (typical: ages 5-10)
Sensei creates most feats
Sensei approves all completions
Frequent check-ins
Heavy scaffolding

Phase 2: Supported Independence (typical: ages 11-13)
Disciple creates 50%+ of feats
Sensei still approves all
Weekly check-ins
Moderate scaffolding

Phase 3: Mostly Independent (typical: ages 14-16)
Disciple creates 80%+ of feats
Sensei spot-checks approvals
Occasional check-ins
Light scaffolding

Phase 4: Transition to Master (future feature)
Disciple ready for Master account
Full independence
Sensei support on request only

Note: Age ranges are guidelines. Some users need more support longer, others less. Adjust to individual needs.

Common Questions

Q: Can I delete a disciple account?
