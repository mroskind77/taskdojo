Approving Feats

Overview

Approving feat completions is the core of your role as a Sensei. This is where you provide accountability, feedback, and encouragement that helps disciples build executive function skills. Done well, approvals celebrate effort, teach self-awareness, and build momentum. Done poorly, they create frustration and erode motivation.

Your approvals matter. This guide will help you do them well.

The Approval Workflow

How Approval Works

Step-by-step process:

Disciple completes a feat
Does the work in real life
Marks feat complete in Task Dojo
Adds optional notes about experience
Requests approval

Feat appears in your queue
Shows up in "Pending Approvals" section
Visible in Disciples dashboard
Badge count shows total pending

You review the completion
Read feat title and description
Review disciple's notes (if provided)
Consider what they accomplished

You rate quality
Choose: Poor, Fair, Good, or Excellent
Determines points earned
Reflects honest assessment

You write a Sensei Note
Encouraging feedback
Specific to this completion
Celebrates effort and guides growth

You approve (or request revision)
Click "Approve" → Points awarded, celebration!
Or "Request Revision" → Guidance given, no points yet

Disciple sees results
Gets notification of approval
Sees quality rating and points earned
Reads your encouraging note
Celebration animation plays!

Rating Quality

The Four Quality Levels

Your quality rating determines how many points the disciple earns and teaches them to assess their own work honestly.

---

⭐ Poor (0.5x - 50% of base points)

When to use:
Disciple struggled significantly
Work was barely completed
Many distractions or resistance
Rushed through with minimal effort

Examples:
Started homework, got distracted repeatedly, rushed at end
Morning routine skipped several steps
Completed task but quality clearly suffered

How to frame in note:
✅ "I can see this was hard for you today. That's okay—you still finished! Let's talk about what made it tough."
✅ "Proud of you for finishing even when it was a struggle. Tomorrow we can try a different approach."
❌ Don't say: "This was terrible" or "You didn't try hard enough"

Remember: You're still approving and giving points. Poor quality still deserves recognition for completion.

---

⭐⭐ Fair (0.75x - 75% of base points)

When to use:
Work was done, some effort shown
A few distractions or challenges
Met minimum requirements
Could have been better but acceptable

Examples:
Completed homework with moderate focus, acceptable quality
Morning routine done with a few skipped or rushed steps
Task finished but could improve

How to frame in note:
✅ "Good job getting this done! I noticed it was challenging today. What would help make it easier next time?"
✅ "You finished even though it wasn't your best day. That resilience matters!"
❌ Don't say: "This was mediocre" or "You can do better"

Remember: Fair is not an insult—it's honest feedback that they accomplished the goal even if not perfectly.

---

⭐⭐⭐ Good (1.0x - 100% of base points)

When to use:
Solid, focused effort
Met expectations clearly
Normal, baseline performance
No major issues

Examples:
Completed homework with good focus
Morning routine done as planned
Task finished competently

How to frame in note:
✅ "Great work! This is exactly the quality we're building toward."
✅ "Well done! You stayed focused and got it done. Keep this up!"
✅ "Nice effort! Your consistency is building real skill."

Remember: Good is your baseline. Most completions should be Good. It's positive recognition, not damning with faint praise.

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent (1.5x - 150% of base points!)

When to use:
Exceptional effort and focus
Exceeded expectations
Went above and beyond
Genuinely impressive work

Examples:
Completed homework early AND reviewed extra material
Morning routine done efficiently with time to spare
Task finished with exceptional care and attention

How to frame in note:
✅ "Wow! You not only finished but went above and beyond. This is what mastery looks like!"
✅ "Outstanding work! Your focus and dedication really showed. So proud of you!"
✅ "This is exceptional! You're setting a new standard for yourself."

Remember: Reserve Excellent for genuine excellence. If you use it too often, it loses meaning. Make it special!

---

Quality Rating Guidelines

Distribution target:
60-70% Good - Your baseline expectation
15-20% Fair - Struggles happen
10-15% Excellent - True exceptional work
5-10% Poor - Significant struggles

Don't:
❌ Always rate Excellent (devalues system)
❌ Punish with Poor unless genuinely warranted
❌ Avoid Fair/Good out of guilt
❌ Compare disciples to each other

Do:
✅ Be honest and consistent
✅ Match rating to actual effort and outcome
✅ Use notes to soften lower ratings
✅ Explain your rating when needed

---

Writing Sensei Notes

Why Notes Matter

Sensei Notes provide:
Specific feedback on this completion
Encouragement and validation
Guidance for improvement
Relationship building
Emotional support

Research shows:
Specific praise is more effective than generic
Effort-focused feedback builds growth mindset
Timely feedback improves learning
Empathetic validation reduces anxiety

---

Note Templates by Quality

Task Dojo includes a Notes Library with pre-written templates in three tones:

Calm Coach - Professional, steady, supportive  
Playful Mentor - Enthusiastic, fun, energetic  
Wise Guide - Thoughtful, philosophical, reflective

You can:
Use templates as-is (fast approvals)
Customize templates (add personal touch)
Write completely custom notes (most personal)

---

Excellent Quality Notes

Template examples:

Calm Coach:
>
 "Outstanding work! Your attention to detail is impressive."

Playful Mentor:
"Wow!
 Knocked it out of the park! Your focus is leveling up! 🔥"

Wise Guide:
"Mas
tery is built one deliberate action at a time. This is one of them."

Customized example:
"Amazing
 work on your math homework, Alex! I can see you really pushed through that challenging problem. This is what growth looks like!"

---

Good Quality Notes

Template examples:

Calm Coach:
"
Great effort! Keep up the excellent work."

Playful Mentor:
"Yes! That
's the energy we're looking for! Keep it going!"

Wise Guide:
"Consistency is the foundation of mastery. You
're building it."

Customized example:
"Well done on your morning routine! I notice
d you made your bed without being reminded. That's real discipline growing!"

---

Fair Quality Notes

Template examples:

Calm Coach:
"You
 finished even when it was hard. That matters. Let's talk about what made it challenging."

Playful Mentor:
"I
 see you pushed through! Some days are tougher than others. You still showed up!"

Wise Guide:
"The path
 to mastery includes difficult days. You walked it anyway."

Customized example:
"I can see
 this homework session was tough today. I'm proud you finished anyway! Tomorrow, let's try breaking it into smaller chunks with the Focus Timer."

---

Poor Quality Notes

Template examples:

Calm Coach:
"I can see this was really
 hard today. Let's figure out what we can adjust to help you succeed."

Playful Mentor:
"Tough day,
 but you STILL finished! That's resilience! Let's talk about how to make it easier."

Wise Guide:
"Even
 masters have difficult days. What you did matters—you didn't quit."

Customized example:
"I know you struggle
d with this one today, and I'm proud you didn't give up. Let's chat about what made it so hard and problem-solve together for next time."

---

Custom Note Best Practices

Make notes:

✅ Specific - Reference the actual feat  
✅ Personal - Use disciple's name occasionally  
✅ Encouraging - Even for struggles  
✅ Actionable - Suggest next steps when relevant  
✅ Honest - Authentic, not formulaic

Examples:

Specific:
"I
 love how you used the Focus Timer for your reading assignment!"

Personal:
>
 "Emma, your consistency this week has been incredible!"

Encouraging:
"
You've completed your morning routine 5 days straight! That's building real discipline."

Actionable:
"Next
 time, try breaking this big feat into sub-tasks using AI Breakdown. I think it'll help!"

Honest:
"
I can tell you rushed this one. I know you're capable of better focus. What was going on today?"

---

Note Length

Guideline:
Minimum: 1 sentence
Ideal: 2-3 sentences
Maximum: 5-6 sentences (save longer for check-ins)

Why brevity matters:
You're approving multiple feats
Disciples read quickly
Quality over quantity
Specific beats long and generic

Short but powerful:
"
Excellent focus! This is exactly what I'm seeing growth in. Keep it up!"

Too long:
"Today you really
 showed me that you're capable of deep focus and sustained attention, which is exactly what we've been working on building together over these past few weeks. I noticed that you..."

---

Approval vs. Revision

When to Approve

Approve when:
✅ Disciple genuinely completed the feat
✅ Even if quality was Poor
✅ Effort was made
✅ Task is done

Remember: Even Poor quality gets approved with points. You're recognizing completion and effort.

---

When to Request Revision

Request revision when:
❌ Feat wasn't actually completed
❌ Disciple marked complete falsely
❌ Agreed-upon standards weren't met
❌ Work needs genuine redo

How to request revision:
Select "Request Revision" (instead of Approve)
Explain what needs to happen
Be specific and kind
Give clear next steps

Example revision notes:
"I see
 you marked this complete, but our agreement was to finish all 10 math problems. Can you complete the last 3? I know you can do it!"

>
 "Let's talk about this one. I noticed your bed wasn't made when I checked. Can you go do that now and then I'll approve?"

"I think
 you might have clicked this by accident—we hadn't even started this homework yet! Let's work on it after snack time."

---

Revision Best Practices

Use revision sparingly:
Not for imperfect quality (use Poor rating)
Only for genuinely incomplete work
Teaching opportunity, not punishment

When you request revision:
Feat returns to disciple's list
No points awarded yet
They can complete and resubmit
You approve on second submission

Don't:
❌ Request revision for every imperfection
❌ Use it as punishment
❌ Set impossibly high standards
❌ Shame disciple for needing revision

---

Approval Timing

How Quickly to Approve

Target: Within 24 hours

Why timing matters:
Immediate feedback is most effective
Delays kill momentum and motivation
Disciples lose context of what they did
Broken streaks due to approval delays create frustration

Realistic timing:
Ideal: Within 2-4 hours
Good: Within 12 hours
Acceptable: Within 24 hours
Too long: 24+ hours

---

Setting Expectations

Communicate your approval schedule:
>
 "I check Task Dojo every evening at 8pm and approve everything from the day."

>
 "I review approvals after breakfast and before bed each day."

"I batch
 approve at lunchtime and again before dinner."

Why this helps:
Disciples know when to expect feedback
Reduces anxiety about "when will Sensei approve?"
Creates predictable routine
Builds trust

---

Batch Approval Strategy

Efficient workflow:

Morning batch (5-10 minutes):
Approve previous evening's completions
Quick reviews with templates
Clear the queue for the day

Evening batch (10-15 minutes):
Approve full day's completions
More thoughtful reviews
Write custom notes
Leave queue empty overnight

Benefits:
More efficient than scattered approvals
Better focus during review
Disciples get consistent timing
Prevents backlog

---

Handling Difficult Situations

Disciple Lies About Completion

What you see:
Marked "Clean room" complete
Room is not clean
Claim they did homework, but didn't

How to handle:

Stay calm - Don't react emotionally
Verify facts - Make sure you're right
Request revision kindly:
   > "I'm seeing this marked complete, but when I checked, it wasn't done yet. Can you go finish it now? I'll approve once it's done!"

If pattern continues - Have serious conversation:
   > "I've noticed several times you've marked things complete that weren't actually finished. Help me understand what's going on. Are the feats too hard? Do you need help?"

Explain consequences - Not punishment, but reality:
   > "When you mark things complete that aren't done, you're only cheating yourself. The points don't mean anything if you didn't earn them. Task Dojo is here to help you build real skills."

Consider if fit - Is Task Dojo right for this disciple right now?

---

Consistently Poor Quality

What you see:
Multiple Poor ratings in a row
Struggling with all feats
Frustration building

How to handle:

Check feat difficulty - Are feats too hard?
Reduce volume - Too many feats?
Use tools - Teach AI Breakdown, Focus Timer
Have conversation:
   > "I've noticed you're struggling with feats lately. What's making it hard? Let's problem-solve together."

Adjust support - May need more scaffolding
Celebrate effort - Even Poor quality deserves recognition for trying

---

Delayed Approvals (Your Fault)

What happened:
You got busy
Forgot to check Task Dojo
2-3 days of pending approvals

How to recover:

Batch approve quickly - Even if notes are brief
Acknowledge delay:
   > "Sorry for the delay in approving! You did great this week—here are your well-earned points!"

Reset expectations - Recommit to timing
Consider workload - Too many disciples?

Don't:
❌ Ignore the backlog (makes it worse)
❌ Lower quality standards out of guilt
❌ Blame disciple for your delay

---

Disagreement on Quality

Scenario:
Disciple thinks they did Excellent work
You rate it Good
They're disappointed

How to handle:

Validate feelings:
   > "I can see you're proud of this work, and you should be!"

Explain rating:
   > "I rated this Good because it met all the requirements solidly. Excellent is reserved for going above and beyond—which I know you're capable of!"

Set future target:
   > "Next time, if you want Excellent, try [specific suggestion]. I know you can do it!"

Emphasize growth:
   > "Good is great! It means you're building consistent quality. That matters more than occasional Excellent."
