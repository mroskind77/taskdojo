Feat Categories

Overview

How to Use Categories

Assigning Categories

When creating a feat:
Choose title and difficulty
Select category (Morning, School, After-school, Nighttime)
Feat is tagged with that category

Can I change categories later?
Not currently (planned for future update)
Choose thoughtfully when creating
Delete and recreate if you picked wrong

---

Filtering by Category

On your dashboard:
Click a category icon (☀️ 📚 ☀️ 🌙)
View shows only feats from that category
Other feats are hidden temporarily
Click "All" to see everything again

Why filter:
Focus on current time of day
Reduces visual overwhelm
Shows only what's relevant now
Morning: see only morning feats
Evening: see only nighttime feats

Example workflow:
Wake up → Filter to Morning category
Complete morning feats → Switch to School
After school → Filter to After-school
Evening → Filter to Nighttime
Check "All" → Review full day

---

Category-Based Planning

Use categories to structure your day:

Morning (1-2 hours):
Essential routines
Non-negotiable starts
Momentum builders

School (6-8 hours):
Structured time
Attendance and engagement
Learning focus

After-school (2-4 hours):
Homework and practice
Most productive work time
Balance work and activities

Nighttime (1-2 hours):
Wind-down and prep
Tomorrow's setup
Rest and recovery

Total: ~12-16 hours of structured time, rest is free/flexible

Category Insights (For Senseis)

Patterns You Can Track

As a Sensei, you can see:
Which categories have most completions
Which categories are being avoided
Time-of-day patterns
Consistent struggles

Example insights:
"Morning feats completed 95%, Nighttime feats only 60%"
  → Focus on bedtime routine structure
  
"After-school homework feats rated 'Poor' quality frequently"
  → Consider breaking down homework, reducing distractions
  
"School feats never completed"
  → Discuss school engagement, possible support needs

Use category data to support your disciple effectively!

Customizing Category Timing

Adjusting for Your Schedule

Categories are flexible:
Shift times based on your schedule
Weekends might have different timing
Summer schedule differs from school year
Personal rhythm varies

Examples of custom timing:

Night Owl Student:
Morning: 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM
School: 1:00 PM - 9:00 PM
After-school: 9:00 PM - 12:00 AM
Nighttime: 12:00 AM - 2:00 AM

Early Riser Professional:
Morning: 5:00 AM - 9:00 AM
Work (School): 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
After-work: 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM
Nighttime: 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM

The category name matters less than the consistency!

Common Questions

Q: Can a feat belong to multiple categories?  
A: No. Each feat belongs to one category. If it spans multiple times, choose primary or break into separate feats.

Q: What if I do homework in the morning?  
A: Put it in "After-school" category anyway (it's homework), or create a custom "Morning homework" feat in Morning category—your choice!

Q: Do I have to use all four categories?  
A: No! Use what works for you. Some users only use Morning and Nighttime.

Q: Can I rename categories?  
A: Not currently. They're fixed to maintain consistency across users.

Q: Do categories affect points?  
A: No. Categories are organizational only. Points come from difficulty, quality, streaks, and age.

Q: What category for weekend tasks?  
A: Use whatever makes sense! Morning chores = Morning. Weekend project = After-school. Bedtime = Nighttime.
