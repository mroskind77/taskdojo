Streaks and Grace Tokens

Overview

Streaks in Task Dojo reward consistency and daily engagement. Complete at least one feat per day to maintain your streak, earn bonus points, and build unstoppable momentum. And when life happens? Grace Tokens give you a compassionate way to save your progress.

What Is a Streak?

Definition

A streak is the number of consecutive days you've completed at least one feat in Task Dojo.

To maintain your streak:
✅ Complete at least 1 feat per day (any difficulty)
✅ Midnight-to-midnight in your timezone
✅ Every day counts, even weekends!

Your streak resets to 0 if:
❌ You don't complete any feats for 24+ hours
❌ You don't use a Grace Token to save it

---

Why Streaks Matter

1. Point Bonuses
Longer streaks = more points on every feat:
3-6 days: +10% points
7-13 days: +20% points
14-20 days: +30% points
21-29 days: +40% points
30+ days: +50% points (maximum!)

2. Momentum & Habit Building
Daily engagement builds discipline
"Don't break the chain" motivation
Small daily actions compound over time

3. Achievement Unlocks
7-day streak: Achievement badge
14-day streak: Special recognition
30-day streak: Avatar skin unlock
100-day streak: Elite status

4. Psychological Benefits
Visible progress
Concrete feedback on consistency
External accountability
Pride in maintaining the chain

How Streaks Work

Starting Your Streak

Day 1:
Complete your first feat
Streak counter shows: "1 day"
No bonus yet (needs 3+ days)

Day 2:
Complete another feat (any difficulty, any time of day)
Streak counter: "2 days"
Still building toward bonus

Day 3:
Complete a feat
Streak counter: "3 days"
+10% point bonus activated! 🎉

Congratulations! You've started earning streak bonuses.

Maintaining Your Streak

Daily requirement:
Complete at least 1 feat within 24 hours of your last completion
Timezone-aware (midnight-to-midnight in your local time)

Any feat counts:
Easy (10 pts) ✅
Medium (25 pts) ✅
Hard (50 pts) ✅
Epic (100 pts) ✅

Quality doesn't matter for streak maintenance:
Poor quality still maintains streak
You just earn fewer points on that specific feat

Pro tip: Create one "Easy" daily feat as a safety net (e.g., "Morning check-in" - 2 points, takes 30 seconds). Even on your worst day, you can maintain the streak.

---

Streak Bonuses in Action

Example: 7-Day Streak

Feat: "Complete homework" (25 base points, Good quality)

Without streak:
```
25 × 1.0 (quality) × 1.2 (age: Cricket) = 30 points
```

With 7-day streak (+20%):
```
25 × 1.0 (quality) × 1.2 (streak) × 1.2 (age) = 36 points
```

Bonus: +6 points (20% increase!)

---

Example: 30-Day Streak

Feat: "Study session" (50 base points, Excellent quality)

Without streak:
```
50 × 1.5 (quality) × 1.5 (age: Stickbug) = 112 points
```

With 30-day streak (+50%):
```
50 × 1.5 (quality) × 1.5 (streak) × 1.5 (age) = 168 points
```

Bonus: +56 points (50% increase!) 🔥

---

Compound Effect Over Time

30 days at 30-day streak vs. no streak:

| Scenario | Daily Feats | Base Points/Day | Actual Points/Day | 30-Day Total |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| No Streak | 3 Medium | ~75 pts | 75 pts | 2,250 pts |
| 30-Day Streak | 3 Medium | ~75 pts | 112.5 pts | 3,375 pts |

Difference: +1,125 points! That's an entire belt level or more!

Streaks are compound interest for discipline.

Breaking Streaks: Life Happens

The Reality

Streaks will break eventually. 
You get sick
Emergency happens
Life gets overwhelming
You forget once
Technology fails

This doesn't mean failure.

Research finding: Broken streaks are the #1 cause of app abandonment. Users feel shame, engage in "all-or-nothing" thinking, and quit entirely.

Task Dojo's solution: Grace Tokens and compassionate recovery.

---

Grace Tokens System

What Are Grace Tokens?

Grace Tokens are your safety net for when life happens. They give you a chance to save your streak or start fresh without shame.

You earn:
2 Grace Tokens per rolling 7-day window
Tokens reset on a rolling basis (not weekly on a specific day)
Use them or lose them—they don't stack infinitely

Example rolling window:
Day 1: Earn 2 tokens
Day 8: Tokens reset (2 new tokens)
Day 15: Tokens reset again

---

When to Use Grace Tokens

You'll see the Streak Savior modal when:
You haven't completed a feat in 24+ hours
Your streak is about to break or has just broken
You have Grace Tokens available

Two options presented:

---

Option 1: Rescue Quest 🗲

What it is: Complete a 30-minute focused task to restore your streak.

How it works:
Click "Start Rescue Quest"
Focus Timer starts at 30 minutes
Work on any feat or task with full focus
Complete the 30-minute session
Streak restored! Grace Token consumed.

When to choose Rescue Quest:
You want to preserve your long streak
You have time for a 30-minute focus session
You want the challenge and accomplishment
You have Grace Tokens available

Requirements:
Uses 1 Grace Token
Must complete full 30 minutes
Must be genuinely focused (honor system)

Message:
"Complete a 30-minute focuse
d task to restore your streak. Your dedication is inspiring."

---

Option 2: Begin Fresh 🔥

What it is: Start a new streak from Day 1 with no shame or judgment.

How it works:
Click "Begin Fresh"
Streak resets to 0
Complete a feat today to start building again
Fresh start, clean slate

When to choose Begin Fresh:
You don't have Grace Tokens
You don't have time for Rescue Quest
You want a pressure-free restart
Your old streak wasn't that long
You need emotional release from streak pressure

Cost: Free, always available

Message:
"Start a new streak
. Every journey begins with a single step. Life happens—we get it."

---

Strategic Use of Grace Tokens

Best practices:

✅ Save tokens for long streaks - Don't waste a token on a 3-day streak  
✅ Use Rescue Quest thoughtfully - Actually focus for 30 minutes  
✅ Know when to let go - Sometimes "Begin Fresh" is healthier  
✅ Don't stress about tokens - They're meant to reduce pressure, not add it

❌ Don't hoard tokens - They don't stack infinitely, use when needed  
❌ Don't fake Rescue Quests - You're only cheating yourself  
❌ Don't stress when you run out - You'll get more in the rolling window

Streak Savior in Action

Scenario 1: Long Streak Worth Saving

Situation:
You have a 45-day streak
You got sick yesterday and forgot to complete a feat
You have 2 Grace Tokens available

Decision:
✅ Use Rescue Quest
Your 45-day streak is worth saving (+50% bonus!)
You have tokens available
30 minutes of focus will restore valuable momentum

Action:
Click "Start Rescue Quest"
Set up focus environment
Complete 30-minute session
Streak restored to 45 days!
1 Grace Token consumed
Continue building from there

Result: Momentum preserved, discipline reinforced, compassion applied.

---

Scenario 2: Short Streak, No Tokens

Situation:
You have a 5-day streak
You were traveling and missed a day
You have 0 Grace Tokens (used earlier this week)

Decision:
✅ Choose Begin Fresh
5-day streak isn't earning major bonuses yet
No tokens available for Rescue Quest
Starting fresh is emotionally lighter

Action:
Click "Begin Fresh"
Streak resets to 0
Complete a feat today
New Day 1 begins!

Result: No shame, fresh start, ready to rebuild without pressure.

---

Scenario 3: Weekend Slip

Situation:
You have a 21-day streak (+40% bonus)
Weekend was hectic, you forgot Saturday
You have 1 Grace Token

Decision:
🤔 Consider carefully
21-day streak is valuable
You have 1 token (your last one for a few days)
Do you have 30 minutes for Rescue Quest?

If yes:
✅ Use Rescue Quest, save the streak

If no:
✅ Begin Fresh, rebuild without stress

Either choice is valid. The system supports you either way.

Streak Philosophy

What Streaks Represent

Not about perfection:
Streaks measure consistency, not flawlessness
A single missed day doesn't erase your discipline
Grace Tokens recognize that life is unpredictable

About building habits:
Daily small actions compound
Showing up matters more than intensity
Consistency beats sporadic perfection

Pressure vs. Motivation:
✅ Streaks should motivate (positive pull)
❌ Streaks shouldn't create anxiety (negative push)
If your streak stresses you out, use "Begin Fresh" guilt-free

---

When to Let Streaks Go

It's OK to reset if:
The streak is causing anxiety rather than motivation
You need emotional release from the pressure
Life circumstances make it genuinely impossible
You want a fresh start psychologically

Remember: Your worth isn't defined by your streak. Your discipline isn't erased by a broken chain. The system is here to support you, not judge you.

Choose the path that serves your wellbeing.

For Disciples: Streaks with Sensei Support

How Streaks Work for Disciples

Same system, with approval workflow:
Complete at least 1 feat per day (request approval)
Streak maintained when Sensei approves
Grace Tokens available
Streak Savior works the same way

Important timing note:
If you complete a feat but Sensei hasn't approved yet, your streak is still "active"
Streaks break only if you go 24+ hours without completing a feat
Approval timing doesn't affect streaks (your effort counts!)

---

Sensei Support for Streaks

As a Sensei, you can:
See your disciple's current streak
Celebrate streak milestones together
Approve feats promptly to maintain momentum
Discuss Rescue Quest vs. Begin Fresh decisions
Model your own streak maintenance

Encourage without pressure:
✅ "Great 7-day streak! How does it feel?"  
✅ "Your streak broke? No problem—let's start fresh!"  
✅ "Want to try a Rescue Quest together?"

❌ "You have to maintain your streak!"  
❌ "I'm disappointed you broke your streak"  
❌ "You should have used your Grace Token"

---

Common Streak Questions

Q: What time does the streak "day" reset?  
A: Midnight in your timezone. Complete a feat between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM each day.

Q: Can I complete multiple feats but only count as one day?  
A: Yes. You need at least 1 feat per day. Extra feats earn more points but don't extend the streak count faster.

Q: Do Grace Tokens stack if I don't use them?  
A: No. You get 2 per rolling 7-day window, maximum. Use them or lose them.

Q: Can I "bank" completions to skip days?  
A: No. You must complete at least 1 feat each day to maintain the streak.

Q: What happens if I forget and my streak breaks?  
A: Streak Savior modal appears. Use a Grace Token for Rescue Quest, or Begin Fresh.

Q: Does Rescue Quest have to be a specific feat?  
A: No! Just 30 minutes of focused work on any feat or task.

Q: Can I pause my streak for vacation?  
A: Not currently. Either maintain it with quick feats, use Grace Tokens, or start fresh when back.

Q: How do I see my longest streak ever?  
A: Check your profile for "Longest Streak" stat.
