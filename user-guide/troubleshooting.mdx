Troubleshooting Guide

Overview

Task Dojo is designed to work smoothly, but sometimes you might encounter issues or have questions about unexpected behavior. This guide covers common problems, their solutions, and how to get help when needed.

---

Quick Diagnostics

Is It Working?

First, check these:
✅ Can you log in?
✅ Can you see your dashboard?
✅ Can you create a feat?
✅ Can you complete a feat?
✅ Do points update?

If any fail, see relevant section below.

---

Account & Login Issues

Can't Log In

Symptoms:
"Invalid credentials" error
Login page keeps reloading
Can't remember password

Solutions:

Wrong email/password:
Double-check spelling
Check caps lock
Try password manager if used
Contact Sensei (if disciple account)

Forgot password:
(Future feature) Click "Forgot Password"
Currently: Contact support via Intercom
Sensei can reset disciple passwords

Account doesn't exist:
Did you complete signup?
Check spam folder for confirmation email
Try signing up again (may already exist)

---

Logged Out Unexpectedly

Symptoms:
Session expired message
Kicked back to login page
Lost work in progress

Causes:
Session timeout (inactivity)
Browser cleared cookies
Multiple tab/window conflicts

Solutions:
Log back in (data is saved)
Avoid long periods of inactivity
Don't clear cookies during session
Use one browser tab for Task Dojo

Prevention:
Stay logged in checkbox (if available)
Bookmark dashboard directly
Regular saves (auto-save enabled)

---

Feat Management Issues

Can't Create Feat

Symptoms:
"Create Feat" button doesn't work
Form won't submit
Error message appears

Common causes:

Missing required fields:
Title is required
Category is required
Difficulty/points is required
Solution: Fill in all required fields

Connection error:
Network timeout
Server temporarily unavailable
Solution: Check internet connection, try again

Browser issue:
Old cached version
JavaScript error
Solution: Refresh page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

---

Feat Won't Delete

Symptoms:
Delete button doesn't work
Feat reappears after deletion
Error message

Solutions:
Refresh page and try again
Check if feat is pending approval (disciples)
Clear browser cache
Contact support if persists

Workaround:
Leave feat incomplete
Hide from view mentally
Report bug via Intercom

---

Can't Find My Feat

Symptoms:
Created feat disappeared
Can't see feat in list

Possible causes:

Category filter active:
Check if you're filtering by category
Click "All" to see all feats
Most common cause!

Deleted accidentally:
Check if confirmation dialog appeared
Feats are immediately deleted
Can't recover (future: trash/archive)

Different account:
Are you logged into correct account?
Sensei vs. disciple accounts separate
Check account name in top right

Solution: Click "All" filter first!

---

Completion & Points Issues

Points Not Updating

Symptoms:
Completed feat, no points awarded
Points stuck at old total
Points calculation seems wrong

For Masters:

Check completion:
Did you complete AND rate quality?
Both steps required
Points awarded after quality rating

Refresh page:
Sometimes display doesn't update immediately
Refresh to see updated points
Background calculation may be delayed

Calculate manually:
```
Expected = Base Points × Quality × Streak Bonus × Age Multiplier
```

Compare to actual points earned

---

For Disciples:

Most common cause: Not approved yet
Points awarded AFTER Sensei approval
Not when you request approval
Check "Pending Approvals" status

Sensei hasn't reviewed:
Wait for approval
Message Sensei if it's been 24+ hours
Points will appear after approval

---

Celebration Didn't Appear

Symptoms:
Completed feat, no confetti
No celebration animation
Missing celebration message

Causes:

Accessibility settings:
Reduced motion enabled
Celebrations automatically simplified
Check Settings → Accessibility

Browser issue:
Animation blocked
JavaScript error
Solution: Refresh and try another feat

Disciple specific:
Celebrations happen after Sensei approval
Not when requesting approval
Wait for approval to see celebration

---

Quality Rating Seems Wrong

For Disciples:
Sensei rates quality, not you
Their rating determines points
This is intentional for learning
Discuss with Sensei if concerned

For Masters:
Did you select correct rating?
Check points calculation
Each rating has specific multiplier:
Poor: 0.5x
Fair: 0.75x
Good: 1.0x
Excellent: 1.5x

---

Streak Issues

Streak Broke Unexpectedly

Symptoms:
Had a streak, now it's 0
Think you completed a feat yesterday
Streak broken but completed today

Common causes:

Didn't complete within 24 hours:
Streaks require at least 1 feat per day
Midnight-to-midnight in YOUR timezone
If you completed at 11pm Monday and 1am Wednesday, you missed Tuesday

Timezone issue:
Check Settings → Profile → Timezone
Incorrect timezone causes streak miscounts
Update to your actual timezone

For disciples - approval timing:
Streak counts when you COMPLETE, not when approved
But must complete something each day
Sensei approval timing doesn't affect streak

Solution:
Use Grace Token if you have one (Streak Savior)
Or accept reset and start fresh
Streaks will break eventually—that's normal

---

Streak Savior Didn't Appear

Symptoms:
Streak broke but no Rescue Quest option
Expected Grace Token, didn't appear

Possible causes:

No Grace Tokens available:
Only 2 per rolling 7-day window
Check if you already used both
Wait for rolling window reset

Haven't broken a streak:
Streak Savior only appears AFTER break
Not preventatively before break
Complete a feat to avoid needing it

Browser refresh needed:
Close and reopen Task Dojo
Should appear on next login after streak breaks

---

Belt & Avatar Issues

Belt Not Advancing

Symptoms:
Reached points requirement
Belt hasn't changed
Still showing old belt

Checks:

Did you actually reach requirement?
Check current points
Check belt requirement
Account for age multiplier adjustments
Your "effective" points may differ from displayed

Points calculation:
```
Age-adjusted points = Raw points × Age multiplier
```

Example: Cricket (1.2x) with 130 raw points = 156 effective points
Enough for Yellow Belt (150)!

Refresh page:
Belt updates should be automatic
Try refreshing browser
Log out and back in

Still stuck:
Contact support via Intercom
Include current points and belt level
Screenshot helpful

---

Avatar Won't Unlock

Symptoms:
Met achievement requirement
Avatar still locked
Can't select new avatar

Verify requirement:

Belt avatars:
Must reach that exact belt level
Not just points, actual belt advancement

Achievement avatars:
Check Achievements page
Verify achievement actually unlocked
Some requirements are cumulative

Common examples:
Streak Lightning: Need 30-day active streak (not just longest ever)
Task Warrior: Need 100 completed feats (check completion count)
Perfect Week: 7 consecutive days of Good+ quality (no Poor/Fair)

Still locked:
Refresh page
Check achievements list
Contact support if genuinely met requirement

---

Sensei-Specific Issues

Can't See Disciple's Feats

Symptoms:
Disciple list shows disciple
Can't see their feat list
Approval queue empty but disciple claims completions

Solutions:

Select disciple first:
Click on disciple name/card
Their feats load separately
Must select to view

No pending approvals:
Maybe disciple hasn't completed anything yet
Or already approved everything
Check with disciple

Permission issue:
Log out and back in
Verify you're logged into Sensei account
Not disciple account accidentally

---

Approval Not Working

Symptoms:
Click "Approve" button
Nothing happens
Error message appears

Solutions:

Must rate quality first:
Select quality rating (1-5 stars)
THEN click approve
Both required

Write note (recommended):
Some systems require note
Write even brief note
Then approve

Connection issue:
Check internet
Try refreshing page
Approval might have worked (check queue)

Browser issue:
Clear cache
Try different browser
Update browser to latest version

---

Multiple Disciples Not Loading

Symptoms:
Can see some disciples, not others
Disciple count doesn't match expected
List seems incomplete

Solutions:

Scroll down:
More disciples below fold
No pagination, just scroll

Filter active:
Check for active filters
"Show only active" or similar
Clear all filters

Account issue:
Were they created under different Sensei account?
Each Sensei sees only their disciples
Can't share disciples between Senseis

---

Technical Issues

Page Won't Load

Symptoms:
White screen
Spinning loader forever
"Something went wrong" error

Quick fixes:

Refresh page:
Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
Hard refresh clears cache

Check internet:
Load other websites
Check WiFi connection
Try mobile data if available

Clear cache/cookies:
Browser settings
Clear browsing data
Last 24 hours
Reload Task Dojo

Try different browser:
Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
If works in other browser = browser-specific issue
Update original browser

---

Buttons Not Responding

Symptoms:
Click button, nothing happens
Hover effects work but click doesn't
Intermittent clicking

Solutions:

Disable browser extensions:
Ad blockers can break functionality
Temporarily disable extensions
Test if Task Dojo works
Re-enable one by one to find culprit

JavaScript disabled:
Task Dojo requires JavaScript
Check browser settings
Enable JavaScript for site

Mobile touch issues:
Screen protector interfering?
Try different part of screen
Restart device

---

Data Not Saving

Symptoms:
Create feat, disappears on refresh
Changes don't persist
Feels like session isn't saving

Causes:

Not logged in:
Check if you're actually logged in
Session expired
Log in again

Network interruption:
Lost connection mid-save
Data didn't reach server
Check connection stability

Browser private/incognito mode:
Some features may not work
Use normal browser window
Cookies/storage required

---

Focus Timer Issues

Timer Won't Start

Symptoms:
Click play, timer doesn't begin
Stays at starting duration
No countdown

Solutions:

Set duration first:
Must have valid duration (5-90 minutes)
0 or invalid = won't start
Check settings

Close and reopen:
Timer modal might be stuck
Close timer
Open again from feat or dashboard

Browser permissions:
Some browsers block timers in background
Keep Task Dojo tab active during timer

---

Timer Stopped Unexpectedly

Symptoms:
Timer was running, now stopped
Lost progress on session
Can't resume

Common causes:

Closed modal:
Closing timer = stops timer
Can't resume partial sessions
Restart if needed

Browser tab inactive too long:
Background tabs may pause JavaScript
Keep tab active during focus session
Or use browser that doesn't throttle

Connection lost:
Timer runs client-side
But may pause on disconnect
Reconnect and restart

---

AI Feat Breakdown Issues

AI Breakdown Not Working

Symptoms:
Click "Generate Steps"
Nothing happens
Error message appears

Possible causes:

API not configured:
Administrator must set up OpenAI API key
Not user-level issue
Contact administrator or use Intercom

Network timeout:
AI requests take 3-10 seconds
Wait patiently
Don't click multiple times

API rate limit:
Too many requests in short time
Wait 60 seconds
Try again

---

AI Suggestions Are Bad

Symptoms:
Generated sub-feats don't make sense
Steps are out of order
Not relevant to your feat

Solutions:

Customize heavily:
AI provides starting point, not perfection
Edit, reorder, delete, add
Make it work for your specific needs

Try different feat description:
More detail in description = better suggestions
Add context AI might need
Re-run breakdown

Create manually instead:
Skip AI entirely
Create sub-feats yourself
You know your needs best

---

Mobile Issues

Mobile Layout Broken

Symptoms:
Elements overlapping
Text cut off
Buttons inaccessible

Solutions:

If using mobile browser, update it
Clear mobile browser cache
Try different mobile browser

Future:
Native mobile app (planned)
Better mobile responsiveness coming

Symptoms:
Text too small
Color contrast too low
Font hard to read

Solutions:

---

Animations Causing Issues

Symptoms:
Confetti makes you dizzy
Celebrations overwhelming
Motion sensitivity triggered
