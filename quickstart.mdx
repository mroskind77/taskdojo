Understanding Points & Belts

How Points Work

Points are earned when you complete feats. The formula is:

```
Base Points = Feat Points × (1 + Quality Modifier + Streak Bonus + Timeliness Modifier)
Final Points = Base Points × Age Category Multiplier
```

Quality Modifiers:
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars): +20%
⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 stars): +10%
⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars): 0%
⭐⭐ (2 stars): -25%
⭐ (1 star): -50%

Streak Bonuses:
7+ days: +10%
14+ days: +20%
30+ days: +30%

Timeliness:
Early (before due time): +10%
On-time (within 30 min): 0%
Late (30 min - 2 hours): -10%
Very late (2+ hours): -25%

Belt Progression

Progress through 8 belt levels:

White Belt - 0 points (starting belt)
Yellow Belt - 150 points
Orange Belt - 350 points
Green Belt - 600 points
Blue Belt - 900 points
Purple Belt - 1,300 points
Brown Belt - 1,800 points
Black Belt - 2,500 points

<Note>
Points are age-adjusted! A Grasshopper (6-9) needs fewer raw points than a Mantis (18+) to reach the same belt level.
</Note>

<Tip>
Pro Tip: Start with just 2-3 feats per day and build up gradually. Quality completion is more important than quantity!
