The Four Age Categories

🦗 Grasshopper (Ages 5-8)

"Building the foundation"

Characteristics:
Simple, concrete tasks
Shorter attention spans

Typical Feats:
Wake up and get out of bed (2 points)
Brush teeth (2 points)
Get dressed (2 points)
Eat breakfast (3 points)
Put away toys (3 points)

Why This Works:
Young learners need quick wins and simple steps. Grasshopper feats are concrete, visual, and achievable. The pace of progression matches attention span and developmental needs.

How Age Categories Affect Progression

Belt Requirements by Age

The base point requirements for each belt are the same across all ages, but the multiplier affects how quickly you earn points:

| Belt | Base Points | Grasshopper (1.0x) | Cricket (1.2x) | Stickbug (1.5x) | Mantis (2.0x) |
|------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| White | 0 | Start | Start | Start | Start |
| Yellow | 150 | ~3-4 weeks | ~3 weeks | ~2-3 weeks | ~2 weeks |
| Orange | 350 | ~7-9 weeks | ~6-7 weeks | ~5-6 weeks | ~4-5 weeks |
| Green | 600 | ~13-16 weeks | ~10-12 weeks | ~8-10 weeks | ~6-8 weeks |
| Blue | 900 | ~21-26 weeks | ~16-19 weeks | ~13-15 weeks | ~10-12 weeks |
| Purple | 1300 | ~31-38 weeks | ~23-28 weeks | ~18-22 weeks | ~14-17 weeks |
| Brown | 1800 | ~43-52 weeks | ~32-38 weeks | ~25-30 weeks | ~19-23 weeks |
| Black | 2500 | ~1+ year | ~10-12 months | ~8-10 months | ~6-8 months |

Times estimated based on ~5-7 base points/day with quality and streak bonuses

Choosing Your Age Category

During Onboarding

You'll select your age category in Step 2 of onboarding. This is important because it:

Adjusts your point multiplier
Customizes preset feat templates
Sets appropriate belt progression pace
Tailors the complexity of suggested feats

Be Honest About Age

Why accuracy matters:
Too young → Progression may feel too slow for your capabilities
Too old → Progression may feel rushed or overwhelming
Just right → System matches your developmental stage and needs

For parents/Senseis:
When creating a disciple account, choose the age category that matches your child's current developmental stage, which may differ from chronological age.

Age Category Multipliers in Action

Example: Completing "Morning Routine"

Base Feat: Morning Routine (3 points, "Good" quality = 1.0x quality multiplier)

Points Earned by Age:
Grasshopper: 3 × 1.0 (age) × 1.0 (quality) = 3 points
Cricket: 3 × 1.2 (age) × 1.0 (quality) = 3.6 points (rounds to 4)
Stickbug: 3 × 1.5 (age) × 1.0 (quality) = 4.5 points (rounds to 5)
Mantis: 3 × 2.0 (age) × 1.0 (quality) = 6 points

With Quality and Streak Bonuses

Same feat with "Excellent" quality (1.5x) and 7-day streak (+10%):

Grasshopper:
3 × 1.0 (age) × 1.5 (quality) × 1.1 (streak) = 4.95 → 5 points

Cricket:
3 × 1.2 (age) × 1.5 (quality) × 1.1 (streak) = 5.94 → 6 points

Stickbug:
3 × 1.5 (age) × 1.5 (quality) × 1.1 (streak) = 7.43 → 7 points

Mantis:
3 × 2.0 (age) × 1.5 (quality) × 1.1 (streak) = 9.9 → 10 points

Developmental Alignment

Why Age Categories Matter

Executive Function Development:

Transitioning Between Categories

When Should You Move Up?

Age-based transitions happen at:
9th birthday → Grasshopper to Cricket
13th birthday → Cricket to Stickbug
16th birthday → Stickbug to Mantis

Current System:
Age category is set during onboarding and remains fixed. Contact support if you need to update your age category due to a birthday or developmental change.

Future Feature:
Automatic age category transitions on birthdays (planned)

---

For Parents & Senseis

Choosing the Right Category for Your Disciple

Consider:
Chronological age (starting point)
Developmental stage (may differ from age)
Current executive function skills
Support needs and independence level

When to adjust:
If your child is significantly ahead or behind their age peers in executive function, choose the category that matches their current developmental stage, not just their age.

Examples:
Advanced 10-year-old: Consider Stickbug (13-15) if managing complex responsibilities
Neurodivergent teen: May benefit from Cricket (9-12) templates despite being 14
Young adult with EF challenges: Mantis (16+) but start with simpler feats

Q: What if I'm between categories?  
A: Choose the one that feels closest to your current needs. You can always adjust preset templates.

Q: Does age category affect anything besides points?  
A: Yes! It also customizes preset templates, suggested feat complexity, and progression pace.

Q: Will my age category automatically update on my birthday?  
A: Not yet, but this feature is planned for future updates.

Q: I'm 25 but struggle with executive function. Should I choose a younger category?
