AI Feat Breakdown

Overview

The AI Feat Breakdown feature helps you transform overwhelming, complex feats into smaller, actionable sub-feats. It's like having a planning coach that breaks down the paralysis wall and makes big tasks doable.

Research finding: 58% of users need mandatory scaffolding for tasks requiring >5 points. AI Breakdown provides that scaffolding automatically.

---

What Is AI Feat Breakdown?

The Problem It Solves

The Starting Wall:
Big feats feel overwhelming
Don't know where to begin
Paralysis sets in
Task gets avoided entirely

Examples of overwhelming feats:
"Study for history test" (feels impossible)
"Clean entire room" (where to start?)
"Write essay" (too many steps)
"Complete project" (undefined scope)

What your brain does:
❌ "This is too much, I can't even start"  
❌ scrolls social media instead  
❌ feels guilty about not starting  
❌ avoids task until last minute

---

The Solution: AI Decomposition

AI Breakdown transforms:

From: "Study for history test" (100 points, Epic difficulty)

To:
✅ Review Chapter 7 notes (10 pts) - 15 minutes
✅ Create timeline of key events (15 pts) - 20 minutes
✅ Make flashcards for vocabulary (15 pts) - 20 minutes
✅ Practice timeline from memory (20 pts) - 25 minutes
✅ Review flashcards with someone (20 pts) - 25 minutes
✅ Take practice quiz (20 pts) - 30 minutes

Total: Still 100 points, but now your brain says:

✅ "I can review Chapter 7 notes. That's 15 minutes. I can do that."

Starting becomes possible.

How AI Breakdown Works

Automatic Suggestion

When creating a feat:

If you set difficulty to Hard (50 pts) or Epic (100 pts), you'll see:

>
 💡 "Big tasks work better when broken down. Let's make it doable!"
>

You can also:
Skip breakdown and create the feat as-is
Break down the feat later from your feat list
Manually create sub-feats without AI

---

The Breakdown Process

Step 1: Trigger Breakdown

Three ways to start:

During creation: When prompted for Hard/Epic feats
From feat list: Click feat → "Break Down This Feat"
From feat details: Open feat → "Use AI Breakdown"

---

Step 2: AI Analyzes Your Feat

What AI considers:
Feat title and description
Estimated difficulty/points
Logical sequence of steps
Appropriate time per sub-feat
Common patterns for this type of task

Processing time: 2-5 seconds

---

Step 3: Review Suggestions

AI generates 3-7 sub-feats:

Each sub-feat includes:
Title (specific action)
Points (sized appropriately)
Sequence number (logical order)
Estimated time (optional)

Example output for "Write essay":
Choose topic and create outline (10 pts)
Research sources and take notes (15 pts)
Write introduction paragraph (10 pts)
Write body paragraphs 1-2 (20 pts)
Write body paragraphs 3-4 (20 pts)
Write conclusion (10 pts)
Edit and proofread (15 pts)

Total: 100 points across 7 manageable sub-feats

---

Step 4: Customize (Optional)

You can:
✏️ Edit any sub-feat title
🔢 Adjust point values
🔄 Reorder steps
➕ Add additional sub-feats
➖ Remove sub-feats you don't need

Why customize:
AI is smart, but you know your specific needs
Personal workflow might differ
Some steps might not apply to you

---

Step 5: Create Sub-Feats

Click "Create Sub-Feats"

What happens:
Original feat becomes a "parent feat"
Each sub-feat created as individual feat
Sub-feats appear as checkboxes under parent
All sub-feats linked to parent
Complete them one at a time!

---

After Breakdown: Using Sub-Feats

Parent Feat Display

Shows:
Original title (e.g., "Study for history test")
Checkbox list of all sub-feats
Progress indicator: "3/6 complete"
Total points remaining

Behavior:
Can't complete parent directly
Must complete all sub-feats
Parent auto-completes when all sub-feats done

---

Completing Sub-Feats

Just like regular feats:

Do the work (e.g., "Review Chapter 7 notes")
Mark complete (checkbox or click feat)
Rate quality (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)
Earn points (with all bonuses applied)
See progress (checkbox ✅, next sub-feat revealed)

As you complete each:
✅ Visual checkbox confirmation
🎉 Points added to your total
📊 Progress bar updates
🔥 Streak maintained
💪 Momentum builds!

---

Completion Satisfaction

The Psychology:

Checking boxes releases dopamine:
Each sub-feat completion = small win
Visual progress is motivating
Breaks "all-or-nothing" thinking
Makes the impossible feel possible

Your brain loves:
✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ← Checkboxes!
Seeing progress visually
Accomplishing small, clear goals
Moving closer to the big goal

Result: You actually finish the Epic feat instead of avoiding it.

---

When to Use AI Breakdown

Automatic Candidates

AI suggests breakdown for:
✅ Hard feats (50 points)
✅ Epic feats (100 points)
✅ Feats with >30-minute estimated time
✅ Multi-step tasks in description

---

Manual Breakdown Candidates

Consider using breakdown when:

You feel paralyzed:
"I don't know where to start"
Task feels too big
Procrastinating for days

Multi-domain tasks:
Requires research + writing + editing
Multiple locations or tools needed
Different types of work (creative + analytical)

Time-blind tasks:
"Clean room" (how long? where start?)
"Get ready for trip" (so many things!)
"Prepare presentation" (many steps)

Learning new skills:
First time doing this type of task
Need scaffolding and structure
Want to build competence

---

When NOT to Use Breakdown

Skip breakdown for:

❌ Simple, single-step feats
"Brush teeth" doesn't need 3 sub-feats
"Send one email" is already atomic

❌ Already clear and actionable
You know exactly what to do
Task is self-evident
No paralysis or confusion

❌ Quick tasks (<10 minutes)
Breaking it down takes longer than doing it
Overhead outweighs benefit

❌ Recurring routines you know well
Morning routine you do daily
Established workflow
No thinking required

Rule of thumb: If you can start immediately without hesitation, skip the breakdown.

Technical Details

How the AI Works

Model: OpenAI GPT-based decomposition
Prompt engineering: Optimized for task breakdown
Input: Feat title, description, difficulty
Output: 3-7 sub-feats with titles and points

AI considers:
Logical sequence (what must come first?)
Appropriate sizing (not too big, not too small)
Standard workflows (research → write → edit)
Common patterns (setup → do → cleanup)
Time estimation

Limitations:
AI doesn't know your specific context
May suggest generic steps
Requires your review and customization
Not perfect, but ~80% accurate

Your role:
Review and adjust suggestions
Add domain-specific steps
Remove irrelevant steps
Personalize to your workflow

---

Privacy and Data

What's sent to AI:
Feat title
Feat description
Difficulty level
Nothing personally identifying

What's NOT sent:
Your name
Your profile data
Other feats
Personal information

Data handling:
Processed by OpenAI API
Not stored long-term
Used only for decomposition
Secure transmission

---

Best Practices for AI Breakdown

Review Every Suggestion

Why: AI is a starting point, not the final answer

How:
Read each sub-feat
Ask: "Does this make sense for me?"
Adjust to your specific needs
Remove steps you don't need

---

Maintain Logical Order

Why: Some steps must happen before others

Check:
Research before writing
Gather materials before creating
Draft before editing
Setup before execution

Reorder if needed - Click and drag sub-feats to rearrange

---

Right-Size Sub-Feats

Too big:
Sub-feat still feels overwhelming
>30 minutes estimated
Solution: Break that sub-feat down further!

Too small:
Sub-feat is trivial (<2 minutes)
Creates unnecessary overhead
Solution: Combine with another step

Just right:
5-30 minutes estimated
Clear, actionable
Feels achievable

---

Complete in Order (Usually)

Why sequential order matters:
Builds on previous work
Logical progression
Prevents rework

Example:
Don't jump to "Edit essay" before "Write essay"!

Exception:
Some sub-feats are independent and can be done in any order (e.g., "Gather materials" and "Research background" might both be first-day tasks)

---

Celebrate Each Checkbox

Why: Every sub-feat is progress

How:
Read the celebration message
Notice your progress bar advance
Feel the dopamine from checking the box
Acknowledge: "I'm making progress!"

Don't rush through - Savor each small win

---
